21938,So I have been struggling with depression for some time. Last year it hit a head when I actually attempted suicide. The problem is that one of my hobbies was rifle shooting. I even had a custom made $1000 rifle I assembled myself. I am a rather skilled marksman (markswoman?) but obviously having guns around is dangerous for me. I ended up selling my guns to a friend. Now my question is a similar but safer hobby I might be able to take up. I am thinking of getting back into archery but I wanted to make this post to see if anyone else had other ideas for a safe hobby like rifle shooting. Want to keep my hobby.,Depression

50126,"old friendship need serious advice (a manic episode read til the end should i call this girl on the phone ) i need you all to be brutally honest. i sent a whole paragraph to a friend/acquaintance about how i didn’t like this girl
and had this whole plan not to sit next to her. (she’s like the most hated girl in school the one i didn’t want to sit by). i made this whole weird plan about her getting there early and bringing binders that are labeled the sport i play on it to pretend we are planning sports camps. then said it would be good for national honors society. honestly if you guys want more information about the message i sent to her i can copy and paste it i just really don’t want to because it’s embarrassing and hard to look back on. she responded well even though she hated her for a while too. she just said “she’s going through a lot just smile” which is a perfect mature answer. i talked to her (when i wasn’t manic) about how she is a really good remodel and i inspire to her and she really liked that. but before i did that ⚠️ IMPORTANT PART ⚠️
i texted my other friend(idk what we are now) about it. i said in voice memos that i was manic and wrote a whole paragraph about how i hated this girl then sent it to my other friend. this other girl who i was talking about before i wrote “important part” is someone she would say rather be friends with then me. then i spammed her with tiktoks afterward the voice memo because i told her i didn’t want to be embarrassing by it in the future??? i don’t know what i said, it was clearly something i’d never say. the REAL PROBLEM is her mother has bipolar. but like the stereotypical bipolar not something that i would be like. she says stuff that you could probably image very disfunctional women and the father is too. this was probably a huge trigger for her. i forgot about it until i tagged her in a post and left me on read. then i asked her questions about the sport and she was never a dry texter and said stuff like 
yes 
no 
sure 
i realized then and remembered what happened. i texted her to ask if i could call her tomorrow and she said “sure” that was like 3-7 days ago though. i’m not sure whether to call her text her or even address this situation. if i did address it how would i, would i call her, text her, or??? this is just a very hard situation and idk what to do. please help me",Bipolar

I have taken Lexapro (recently increased from 10 mg to 15 mg a month ago) and this is the first psychiatric medication I have ever taken. I have been on it since March 2021. At first I felt like it was working great, I was on top of the world for about 2 months and now I am not really feeling the effects any more.I have felt ""off"" for a few weeks now. I am currently about to graduate grad school next month and am finishing up my internship. I have a few things going on right now: finishing up school/graduating, starting a new job within the next 2 months, turning 26 and getting booted off my parent's health insurance, having 3 friends move out of our apartment and 3 new random roommates whom I do not know at all moving in to live with me. Normally I would feel anxious and stressed, but I feel nothing. Not in a good way, but numb. I could start to notice something was wrong when I would get home from work and immediately go to my bedroom. I felt like I could not bring myself to hang out with my friends or roommates. I will ignore texts/snaps/calls, etc. because I feel like I cannot be happy/excited and match the energy of the other person. I went on a cabin weekend trip 2 weeks ago with my friends and I felt like I was almost having an out of body experience, watching them drink and have fun and I was just existing there, not saying anything because I felt like I had nothing to add. I am still able to sleep a normal amount, go to work, maintain a relationship with my S/O (although I feel exhausted and horrible and like I cannot be a good girlfriend in this state), and take care of hygiene and all that.

21045,"I grew up in suburban Tennessee, in a borderline fundamentalist Christian community. My childhood was extremely comfortable, happy, and sheltered. I love my parents, they are genuinely caring, funny, enjoyable people. I never really acted out and I always did well in school. Never once did I fear for my future or worry about what was going to happen to me in adulthood. When I was a senior in high school, I started to act out. I had a disrespectful, rude boyfriend. Looking back, I fully understand why my parents did not like him, but he was my first boyfriend and teenage me was blinded by how much I loved him. While we were dating, a tried weed and we had s\*x, but like most normal teenagers I kept this from my parents. One day, my dad happened upon a fairly explicit text from him, and I was told to immediately stop dating him. I refused. This continued repeatedly throughout my senior year, with threats to not send me off to college and constant yelling/crying matched between them and I about why god disapproves of me and why it was hurting them so much that I was s\*xually active. I eventually lied to them and told them I broke up with my boyfriend. The summer between senior year and college, I saw him secretly all the time. I was constantly lying. It felt horrible, but I was so dumb and in love I did it anyway. I regret this time in my life a lot. I went off to college somewhere far away (majored in music) and even then my dad was reading my texts. He read one about me going to smoke weed with some friends, and immediately cut me off. I started to strongly believe I needed to be independent. I never asked for help from my parents. I got a job and worked almost everyday between classes my entire freshman year. I paid for everything but my tuition. Although I was proud of myself for this at the time, It started a pattern that i could not reverse. It felt like I could not tell my parents anything for fear of losing them and losing the only real support system I had. I would not give them intimate details about my life anymore. I would not tell them when I was sad. I would not tell them when I would go to the doctor. I would not tell them when I got a diagnosis. I would not tell them if I was going to therapy. I only ever told them the positives. I would tell them if I would achieved something, or just had a normal, happy day. This worked for me for a long time. During college, I worked enough that I never had to ask for anything. I had my moments of sadness or worry, but I was happy knowing my life was stable. I broke up with my deadbeat boyfriend eventually, which was for the best, and suddenly my parents were proud of me again. The summer between my sophomore and junior years (age 20), I stayed with my parents and interned at a music company. I had a rough summer because I started randomly hooking up with guys (which was not my thing) and I had to get my appendix removed which brought on several complications. My parents knew I was up to something all the time and started treating me coldly again. The withdrew their normal, funny, friendly selves and barely interacted with me. By this time I was tired of arguing with them, so I just did not confront them about it. But even so, they enforced an 11 o clock curfew on me, and still occasionally bemoaned that I was not a Christian. This perpetuated the belief I already held, which was that my parents' hospitality towards me was conditional. It relied on me conforming to their idea of me. When I went back to school in the fall, the distance made things better. I started dating my current boyfriend, who I obviously could sleep with and hang out with and do anything with without my parents knowing, so they were in the dark, and perfectly happy about our relationship. My junior was incredibly happy. I had a boyfriend I loved, and my parents treated me like they were proud of me. Senior year came along and I began to consider my life after graduation. My boyfriend and I planned to move in together with a few of our friends as well. We were going to move to LA. This idea settled in the back of my mind during school, and then became the focus when I graduated. I came back to my parents' house this summer (I am 22 and I graduated in May) and the plan is to leave for Los Angeles at the end of July. I have been applying for jobs constantly. Incessantly. I wanted so badly to get a job before I told my parents I was moving in with my boyfriend. I have worked day in and day out and I have not received a single email back. I understand this is how the music industry is, but my fear of moving out there and having no help from my parents at all because they do not believe in living with someone before you are married is enormous. My dad once told me that if I moved in with a boyfriend I better be able to completely support myself because I could not expect any help from him. I am exhausted by the amount of work I have done at this point, and completely emotionally drained by the fact that I have no acceptances or denials, just radio silence. I have become so obsessive and stressed about it that my entire brain is consumed. I cannot be distracted. I cannot even sleep well. I am a gigantic disappointment to myself, even though I know the industry I am trying to get into has very high barriers to entry. I have never in my life had no job, no school, and no purpose. My parents still treat me differently because I am not a Christian. I do not go to church with them (because of a particular incident where I ran out crying because the sermon was about homosexuality and sex before marriage). My mom barely talks to me on these days. I have stopped exercising and eating healthily completely. I am on my phone an ungodly amount. I cry everyday and spend the other parts either applying to jobs or laying in bed looking at meaningless crap on instagram. I have an extremely low tolerance for stress now. I can become debilitatingly anxious at the drop of a pin. I do not think I am the same person to my friends or my boyfriend. I am not as funny or lighthearted, I am really easily socially exhausted. I just want to be better. I want to be kind to people and be a great friend and a great girlfriend. I really desperately want a close relationship with my family, but I am so scared of losing them if I am too honest. I cannot tell how much of my depression is situational and how much of it is something more chronic... and I cannot tell which option I should attempt to remedy first.

I know everyone is life is different and so is mine, but I am unable to shake this feeling of worthlessness off my mind.Not in contact with any of my schoolmates but I accidentally/out of curiosity looked up for one of my BFFS on SM and find out that she is doing great.Married, has kids and a career. I feel that I have been stuck in this phase for this many years without making any progress. Why does my life turn out this way. I have had everything in life but still why is everyone else ahead of me in terms of career and personal life.I too have a personal life and in no way am I comparing it with that of others but still it feels like rubbing salt on an already sore wound. I am already having trouble coming to terms with my life and trying to make progress, unfortunately to no avail, and then seeing others make it seem so easy (in no way am I saying that they have had it all easy, it is that they easily do those things that I struggle with in my everyday life) is so depressing.Since my school days I have had nothing but tears and struggles, and I still do not see myself as an independent woman (that is so annoying) and seeing my 'once upon a time bff' settled in life is making me question my existence even more.

I do not even have that many friends to begin with because of online school and people kind of just forgetting me. A close friend and my ex just started hanging out and that is only adding to my pain. And I have a medical condition making it hard for me to participate in my favorite activities over summer.

However, it's all I can think about.

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

51021,"'chicken or the egg' situation- do I treat the physical symptoms (panic attacks) or the core issue (childhood trauma/feelings of inadequacy) Due to an array of weird circumstances, I am a manager. A manager with avoidant personality. A manager who can't even say hi to her coworkers or ask for help. A very necessary skill for a manager. A manager who is visibly pushing down a panic attack each moment, choking on words and shaky hands. And you're too scared to ask to step down bc you already done so 3 times..

I have no idea whether to tackle the somatic issue, my panic attacks/nervous system arousal or the core issue, which is my feelings of not being worthy. I feel like I am inherently toxic and cold. I never say hi to anyone, even though a manager should be approachable and amicable...

I will say; I focused a bit on healing somatically/the physical symptoms. At least with somatic healing I don't lock down and go onto a full blown panic attack anymore, where I am mute and shut down. I know my limit.

I been a manager for a year now. I been avoiding my family, my career is falling apart and I have lost all my friends. I need help but I feel like financially it is not possible. 

I want to be medicated but SSRIs didn't do jack for me. Weed just bites you in the long run. Not sure if meds can ever really heal this. I just want to stop having panic attacks. But i know my core issues/inner monologue ans my unprocessed childhood trauma are what kick me into panic mode everyday. Panic mode makes me mute and silent, which peoppe percieve negatively.

14602,"I am 27 years old and have grown deeper into a depression since I was about 24/25. When the going gets tough, my mind goes to suicide more quickly. I have this odd obsession with death even outside of suicide (no, I have never had the urge to hurt anyone. Its more of a pondering). I am just going to go on a rant. Maybe you will have advice, support, or inspiration. Ill take it. Surfacing complex family issues are unraveling forcing me to confront my perfect childhood as a facade. My mom needs counseling and will not help herself. She hates me possibly because I was a daddys girl, and my dad was lying, cheating, and manipulating her for most of their marriage. They stayed together for the kids until I was 17. Despite this I have always seen my father as more of the logical, stable, and supportive parent. Now I wonder if he actually loved me or if that was a facade too, psychopathic even? It seems melodramatic typing that out but as my dad gets older and his political views 180, I wonder if I even know the real person behind my father. My mother cannot see me as anything other than an unruly, irresponsible teenager even though I have supported myself financially 100% since I was 18 and been employed since I was 15. she is toxic and constantly negative. I keep falling for her tricks of inviting me to house-sit for her abroad (she built this house with child support money that I have never seen a dollar of). then when I arrive after a $500 flight and getting permission from my work to stay employed remotely, she flips the script: she stays for 2.5 weeks, makes me pay her bills while I am here, tells me to bring a friend and then talks shit about them the whole time to me, and me to them. She shames my body and my sexuality making me feel worthless. I am flexible to accommodate for her change in plans and then she flips whenever, thinking she is doing ME a favor for letting me stay in her beautiful Costa Rican house. The last time I tried to tell her how I felt about our relationship she said I needed to seek help with that. Which yes, I clearly do need lots of therapy and counseling. But our relationship will not heal unless she gets help too. I am thinking about cutting her out of my life completely. Then, there is the constant existential dread I have about not finding my purpose. I have a useless degree in photography and keep taking these dead end jobs just above minimum wage despite knowing I am intelligent, creative, with a strong work ethic (if I am being challenged and care). I get rejected from the more esteemed jobs I apply to due to lack of experience. Everyone says I am so passionate and talented with photography, but I have grown to hate it. The selfie culture of social media and bragging seems so fake and morose to me. I have decent photos but have grown to hate my own work and question whether I really have any talent at all, preventing me from pursuing it more. My insecurities are building all the time. Its difficult for me to find peace with my face, body, personality, whole self despite being toldIm attractive, sexy, funny, and kind. I think my personality has become boring and empty in the last 3 years. It feels like there is a large black hole in my throat that is eating me alive from the inside-out. I find small talk unbearable and anxiety inducing. In a one-on-one situation I am good at connecting with most people. In a group setting I feel awkward, alone, uncomfortable and empty. I used to love going out to concerts to shoot the band, dance, and socialize. I felt so in my element. Now, even dancing feels forced and I watch everyone having fun, feeling joy and I feel lost. I am currently in an open relationship with my boyfriend who loves me dearly, and I him. Sometimes however it feels like I am settling because of lack of attraction and a deeper connection. We can go deep kind of and I feel as if out of anyone, I can talk to him the most. But always, I am still guarded of my deeper selfthe one that constantly thinks of suicide or my worthlessness. I think there is someone out there who is more of an intellect, world traveled, experienced, and attractive to me. Someone big and strong that can hold me and inspire me. I feel guilty for even having these thoughts and wonder if I truly love him or if he fills the void of my loud mind and loneliness. Maybe I need the open relationship due to my commitment issues. Ormaybe its because hes not the one for me and I think I can possibly find that person on the side. Clearly I need to love myself first before I can really love someone else, right? Still this is the most stable romantic relationship I have ever had and I am not ready to end it. And lastly there is the friendships in my life. I was the type of person that got along with all the cliques in high school and bounced around. I am still close with a few of my high school friends. However, I feel as if they have all moved on without me, even my bestie, and I am the worst at staying in touch. Sometimes Ill send bday presents and reach out randomly. When we see each other, there is nothing but love. However I live across the country and nobody makes an effort to check in on me. It seems one-way. I lost touch with my college friend groups, both of them. They all still go on trips together and I have never been invited. My bestie from college did not invite me to her wedding (its small, but still) and I honestly thought wed be friends for life. I had a big falling out with 2 of the girls in my girl group in the summer of 2020. They were my main links to the crew and essentially, I was exiled. I still photoshop of all of them together on social media and I feel alone and forgotten. One of the issues was covid related with varying reactions and living standards during the pandemic. And the other was over a guy my friend met on tinder who was also chatting with me on a fetish website. When I figured out it was the same guy, I stopped talking to him and we never met or flirted or anything. Nothing. He texted me randomly saying he did not want to be with my friend and I stayed out of it thinking I was doing the right thing. She said I broke girl code by not telling her. Maybe she is right. But fuck that. Not worth fighting over I am going to. On a current noteyesterday I was enjoying my day off work, running on the beach and i stop to say hi to a dog with a collar (thinking it was this dudes dog sitting 20 feet away). This dog adopts me. Follows me all day, everywhere. I try to bring it back to where it initially started following me but it will not leave my side. At night it came back to my house and I gave her water and food. she slept outside as she is riddled with fleas. Today I tried to post her online in a local forum, walked her up the beach and to a vet, reached out online, spoke to a few people in the street. Nothing. When the vet rejected to take her, it broke me. I went back to the beach and started crying. What was I going to do with this pup? I thought about the people that had her tied up and most likely mistreated her so much that she chewed the rope off (there was a knot on the collar). I thought about none of the people that wanted to help her. And I compared myself to these people as I was just one of them. I could not bring the dog back to my moms house as she is against strays or rescues and has a cat. I went for a swim and this dog tried to swim out for me but could not make it and eventually gave up. As I treaded water, she ran up and down the beach searching for me for about half an hour. I had to swim to a nearby beach to avoid her finding me. I am a bleeding heart for animals and this also broke me. I feel responsible as if I were her original owner abandoning her. I think about how confused she must be and if she tried to swim out again after I left. I have been seriously considering ending my life with alcohol and Xanax pills which I have access to (they are my moms. it would be ironic at least). I always play out the scenario in my mind. Thinking about my mom and how she would think I was selfish and weak. Thinking about how I did this to her purposefully as opposed to doing it to end my meaningless and lonely life. To end the suffering. To quiet my mind forever. To make space for others potentially and stop wasting resources. What stops me is knowing that I want to travel and blow my funds before I end it all. I want to see the world and meet people from different cultures. I want to learn new languages, get lost in strange cities and towns, hike up beautiful mountains, see awesome landscapes, scuba dive, live by a beach and get decent at surfing, share laughs and connect with strangers, maybe help others, even in simple ways. Maybe find someone who seems out of my league that is intelligent and challenges my thoughts and ideas. That wants to travel with me, even if In a dirty old van or on motorcycles. If I died, people would say she had her whole life ahead of her and they would be right. But I do not think it will get better. Maybe it gets worse. Maybe the noise expands, maybe I self destruct my romantic relationship, have no friends, and get stuck in the dead-end jobs forever. Get old and regret not quitting more to live a life of fulfillment. Maybe the black hole in my chest expands and swallows me whole. I wish it would already.

35397,"Breast cancer anxiety As the title suggests, my HA specialty is breast cancer. I do not have a family history of it; I’m 33 and live a very active, healthy life. But I live in almost constant fear of finding a lump and being given a death sentence. Like they are ticking time bombs. I check myself daily during the bad HA cycles (usually tied to menstrual cycle) and in several extra dark times, have convinced myself my ribs, muscle tissue, etc. are lumps. Always to be reassured by my OB that they aren’t and that I’m low risk and completely healthy. It makes me crazy though. Sometimes I even feel breast pain, which I’m pretty sure is psychosomatic because when I’m busy/preoccupied I don’t feel the pain. But when I obsess, I feel it constantly and live in a loop of crazy anxiety. I’m driving my husband nuts and the worrying often robs me of other joys. But I don’t know how to overcome this. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has this particular worry and if they’ve had any success getting past it. ",Anxiety
34766,"Should I be concerned about stomach cancer? I’m a 24 year old male. 2 years ago I started having symptoms described below and it would come and go every couple months. So about 2 months ago I started having stomach issues with gas, being constantly full, zero appetite and little pains in my stomach. The pains faded after 2 weeks and the last 2 months it feels as if my stomach isn’t producing enough acid. I don’t know what is going on. I have zero pain during or after eating. The only symptom I have is the feeling of my food not being digested after eating and being full for hours and hours after eating. I have ZERO appetite. And also after eating my gut gets very gurgle and makes lots of noises.

I’ll even workout twice a day and fast till dinner and still have zero appetite. I usually consume 400-600 mg of caffeine wether it’s multiple cups of coffee, tea or pre workout so I don’t know if that is bad. My anxiety has been very high worrying about stomach cancer.

51516,"Contemplating So I've noticed that when I contemplate my inevitable death, I feel strange. I can think about if I die tomorrow, the next day, or amy other time, but when I remind myself that it is virtually impossible for me to live past say 120ish, it feels different.

I think about how nothing I do will ever prevent me from dying, and really, it is the only time I feel so...human. I feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing I ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity. 

A hundred years after I die, what should I care? I'd be dead, so whatever I do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far. Besides, by that point whatever hopes I had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me. 

What I'm getting at is, I'm nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me. It feels very human to me, that feeling of nigh nothingness. 

That is why I'd consider myself religious, because it's the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about, and that the things that I do will matter for the rest of eternity.

 I know it sounds crazy, and people have told me repeatedly that I'm stupid for believing in anything, but what else do I have? I've gotten as close to the edge as I could before, just to see if I would do it. Clearly I didn't, but if I didn't have some hope that my faith is worth it, well, you know. 

Anyways, what I'm getting at is that I'm religious because it makes me feel wanted, like I have a purpose, even if it's not entirely clear to me or anyone else really. 

I hope y'all have good coping mechanisms too, because I can take a good guess at what my life would look like if I didn't have my faith.

And for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someone's religion, I'm truly sorry that you had to go through that. Nobody should have to experience that. And I hope you don't think any less of me for my faith, I wouldn't try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me, and I don't get to choose how you live your life.

At the end of the day, I do sincerely hope y'all are doing okay. ❤️",Personality disorder

She makes me want to kill myself, (which may be her goal in the end) criticizing every move I make. My siblings are the opposite of me, judge mental, rude, yet so so fake. When I am in public with my mom, she masks her behavior really well. I am contemplating suicide in the future as everybodys judgements have gotten the best of me. Every move I make, I doubt myself - because of them, or question what I am doing. (Which I have never done before, and have always been pretty confident when making decisions/thinking for myself.) How would you stand up for yourself in my situation? I have always been closed off, afraid to say what is really on my mind.) I am not necessarily sensitive to criticism but their judgements about my appearance and whatnot have gotten the best of me. I do not connect well with most of my family, even my fathers side now, so why should I force myself to get along with people who treat me with ultimate disrespect? they are very driven by materialistic things and get overly excited about certain things/items they have gotten to touch up their appearance. I am not sure why my family has such an issue with me, slandering my name - which used to get nothing but praise. In the end, I am not going to mask my personality for ones pleasure.

15004,"really feel like my therapy is not working out. I am not sure if I am the one in the wrong, and I am trying to look at it from all perspectives, so please help me out. I have been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. I am a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i did not like her and i wanted to switch. they did not listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i do not at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she does not understand what I am trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for not trying hard enough even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that I am not trying hard enough she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we do not have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that I am not trying. if she does not think I am trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because I am not using the resources I am given which i totally understand that I am very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for not trying even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says I am just glamourizing/ glorifying death and that i think its cool. which is rlly invalidating because she is basically saying I am suicidal for attention and because i think its cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i do not at all think its cool, but i feel so trapped that i do not see any other way out and I am in so much unbearable pain that i cannot survive anymore she tells me no i think you are just glamorizing it which upsets me further. she tells me to choose happiness which again, i get where she is coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that its rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that its my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says hey how are you and i said I am good, how are you to be polite she says ugh that is not what you are supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you do not even try. if you keep this up I am going to have to tell your parents you are not trying. also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it does not sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said hey i really do not feel like i fit this at all, but I am open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i do not want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms. so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said things that were completely false (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her that is not what happened for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent the majority of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because at the time my family was being very unsupportive and i was not allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said kids with NVLD often are loners or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l and i said i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??! and she was like i think its fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like there is literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder its complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but its not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me. i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says yeah that does not seem like NVLD but i still think you have it. like when she asks me a question and i say i do not know because i do not like being put on the spot she says that that is not understanding broad concepts so i automatically have NVLD. its just so frustrating. i told her I have done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she does not listen. my mom has done the same thing and also says she does not see how it relates to me because I am good at reading social cues, know what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself.

If I’d just taken the steps I wanted to be who I wanted to be and not so frightened of them.

I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with, guilt free.I just, I do not know, I guess I just needed to say it, not expecting advice, or help, just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head.

13150,"tw// eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it, but I will try. Okay, so I always loved eating, it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid (20s now). When I was 18 or 19 (when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city) I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do, like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year (early 2020) I realized I was getting high so I can eat more/open up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier (I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS) but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food, such as hamburgers, chips, ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days, sometimes multiple in a row, where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regular-sized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So, I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing, that I am disgusted by binge eating (I still do it tho)? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this, thank you I am disgusted by food",Depression

35358,"Intense body aches from aftermath of a common cold So basically 8 days ago, I caught the common cold and was hit with the usual 3 - sore throat, cough and runny nose. During the course of the sickness, I experienced sweating at night and joint pains. Fast forward to today, I no longer have the 3 symptoms, I might even add that I feel recovered! However, the oddity is that the body aches and joint pains still lingers as if I was sick and it has been affecting my sleep. If I were to describe the pain, it feels like it's my entire body with the most painful part being my rib/torso area. I was wondering if this is normal? Any thoughts?

34690,"Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering cold-like viral symptoms for the last 10 days, and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat, but has now progressed to a hacking, productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today, although admittedly it feels muscular.

Roughly 4 days into my symptoms (6 days ago now) I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However, I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.

Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. 

I mean, as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death, this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about. ",Anxiety

51951,"Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again?? The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn’t anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it’s because I started a new job last month and I’m falling back into my old health anxiety habits because “Stress compounds symptoms”. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven’t even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I’m fine I thought I’d be okay but I’m still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I’m calm it doesn’t go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can’t stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that’ll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It’s just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165. This constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life. How do I stop this??",Anxiety

I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit.

You walked into a waiting room with two receptionist windows on the other side. The receptionists sat behind frosted glass windows that were closed, and in front of each was one of those bells. There were no signs specifying which window to go to or even saying ""please ring bell for service"".  I must have stood there fidgeting for 3 or 4 minutes before finally knocking on the window lightly (no way was I gonna ring a bell in a quiet office). Then, while I was filling out my paperwork they decided to turn on music and it was the Braveheart soundtrack.  So, I'm sitting there listening to the sountrack to a film where someone gets disembowled and it occurs to me that they can't be THAT stupid and they must have hidden cameras or something to see what their patients do in such an uncomfortable situation.

I'm trying to actively work on my financial situation which is causing me the most stress however I don't know what to do to get a second job cause most demand open availability but won't give you a lot of hours...

It doesn't really help that I drink alcohol on my time off a couple days a week and come to work hungover twice in the past month to make the job easier.

I mean seeing a therapist would be beneficial but I don't have health insurance for a few more weeks at least and it would worsen my financial situation. I'm looking into seeing if I can use one of my boyfriend's free counseling sessions he gets from his job cause I doubt he will use them (unless he needs them but it seems like right now he's doing fine and I'm an anxious wreck).

46390,"Improving Physique and Body Confidence causing onset of some mania symptoms? Hey guys, I’m a 22 yo male in college and I have been lifting 6 days a week for a while now. I would say I’m pretty built and over the last few weeks I have definitely been becoming more defined (guess that happens when the holiday season and all the food that comes with it finishes haha). My body confidence is definitely improving and my attitude in general has become better because of it. The issue is the last time I really looked good it caused me to almost have too much confidence and for someone with bipolar I feel this could be an issue. The last time I crashed there were a lot more factors involved and I have learned a lot since. I do not drink alcohol anymore and I have cut back my marijuana usage substantially. I am currently eating a normal amount of food and getting enough sleep everyday. But I’m noticing some possible signs of some type of mania coming if I’m not careful. This means I will probably have to up my meds dealing with the mania, but these meds often cause weight gain, so taking more may take away a lot of what I have worked for exercise-wise. I feel like I’m stuck in that I have to make a choice between my mental and physical health (along with my body confidence). I will obviously choose mental health if push comes to shove because I do not want to experience the same crash that I did last time, but it just feels unfair. 

Has anyone had some type of experience with this? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist coming up and I’m wondering what is best to say to her. It’s just a really frustrating scenario I haven’t seen talked about before. Thank you for reading!",Bipolar

51075,"The hollow self My life is spent largely devoted to work. Between morning prep, commute, actual work hours, and evening prep like laundry, packing lunches, and other small maintenance tasks I only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. After all, I need to be in bed at a decent hour or else I won’t be well-rested for the next work day. That’s it. That’s my life.

Meanwhile, even though I’m so devoted to work that I sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it, I’m barely earning enough money to survive. I have over $50,000 in debt that is slowly growing as I struggle to make ends meet. I don’t know if I can ever pay it off. I can pay off maybe 1/3rd of it if I really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. I’m turning 40 in 6 months.

At what point am I supposed to go from “surviving” to “thriving”? I know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but I just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. What is my purpose? Why am I grinding on the world’s worst-ever RPG system? I feel like I’m on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year, and at some point I know I won’t be able to keep up.

My job itself is relatively easy, I’m a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. For the most part it’s just pulling reports for managers and being really good at Excel and Power BI. Though I don’t know if I’m that good at my job. Tomorrow marks 1 year in this position, and every night I feel like I’m doing the bare minimum. Like I’m that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. I imagine they say things like, “He’s so slow. What’s he even doing all day?” or “I better schedule this meeting because if I wait for him to do it, it’ll never get done.” They don’t say these things out loud of course, and maybe they don’t even think them… but maybe they do. Maybe I’m just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. I think I’m ok because my head is still above water, but realistically if I keep doing this I will drown. I need to swim.

I just feel like such a loser, all the time. I don’t have kids, and I don’t want them. I’m not married, but I’ve been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. We live together. She makes a lot more than I do, so she pays the mortgage and I pay everything else. It’s probably not a fair arrangement for her, but I just literally don’t make enough to split everything 50/50. She earns $40k more than I do a year. She would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. Then we could split the 4th one, that would make it even. Even with that justification in my mind, it makes me feel like a loser. Not that she makes more than me- good for her! She deserves it! Just that I can’t contribute equally. I feel like a mooch. We work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work. But her’s pays more. Them’s the breaks I guess.

Overwhelming shame. About nearly everything.

I’m too fat. I’m too bald. I’m too old.

I’m not smart enough. I’m not rich enough. I’m not funny enough.

I know those are called “automatic negative thoughts”, or ANTs, and like ants they should be easy to squash. I’ve read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books. I would go to therapy, but it’s expensive. My company pays for 3 sessions a year. The other 49 weeks you can fuck off and die, I guess.

Is there more to this life? Is this all I’m supposed to do? Click buttons all fucking day, sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show, then repeat? All day, every day, until I’m old enough to scrape by on social security? This is it, huh? This is the whole fucking thing?

There needs to be more, because I swear sometimes it just doesn’t feel worth it. I’m not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going?

I have hobbies and interests, and I indulge in them as often as I can. I grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces, I hike in the woods and enjoy nature, there’s so many things to occupy my free time—if I HAD ANY- but the fact is I devote 87.5% of my day to making someone else richer. So my measly 3 hours a day- which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set- are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking. I have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because I can’t even be present to tend to my own garden.

It’s absolutely ridiculous.

When exactly am I supposed to do anything of substance, of value?

3 hours in the fucking dark.

That’s what I get to live off of.

Most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt.

$50,000 would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years. Meanwhile, I get to help analyze the company private jet spend. Cost us over $365,000 to operate for a total of 11 days last month. We paid $75,000 just in pilot fees for the month of January. I don’t earn that in a year. So when I see how much money there is, how much is available to toss around, and just how little of it I get… why would I “work harder”? Why would I sign up for more of this disrespect?

I just don’t know why. Why can’t I work 4 days instead of 5? Why can’t I be remote, considering I have only had 1 face-to-face meeting in the last month? I’m wasting a ton of money on a car that I primarily use to get to work, a ton of money on a special wardrobe that I only wear at work—it’s absurd. And depressing.",Personality disorder

I can said I have hight functioning AvPD. I go to work , teach my classes .I'm constantly wanting to improve and develop a strong career path and get enough money for surviving in a Latin American country. 

But a few things happened while in quarantine , I was depressed , isolated with my family, grieving that a part of my body wasn't functioning well and got removed that destroyed me and on top of that my religious trauma and the stupid comments of my mother who things all the things need to be her way or not be at all. She hurt me terribly. 

Anyways , as I isolated i created a new perspective of shame and was constantly bullied by neighbors for my attitudes and behaviors as I was bragging a lot due to my  financial and career position were higher than of those adults around me just at 22. I know that's awful  and was against my original principles but I  think I just tried to cope. I'm more mature i recognize it was a mechanism to avoid rejection and shame.

19107,"Hello, I am 30 and I do not have a life nor prospects for a career. I was depressed due to abusive parents and the great recession. Then I failed to find a job that would allow me to support myself after I graduated college at 21. I coasted for a year doing odd jobs and several vacations. Soon afterwards I became severely depressed and went catatonic until recently. that is just the background. I was a top 20% student coming out of high school (despite already being depressed.) Although due to self harm as a teenager I have a bad back and knees so cannot do anything where I need to stand or work with my hands. As my mental health continued to decline I had to switch to a humanities major and graduated with a 3.6 GPA. Those circumstances combined with mental health issues leads to where I am at today. I actually spent the pandemic trying to go back to school studying computer science, but I am unable to retain any information. I ended up with a 3.2 GPA and I was only taking 2 courses per semester at a relatively easy school.I was and am an attractive person so I had no trouble getting laid while on vacation several years back. My appearance is not the issue, I look almost the same, I have severe mental health issues that prevent me from having log term relationships with anyone let alone a romantic partner. I am not an incel per say, but not having a social life has had a huge impact on my mental health. (I strongly suggest to most depressed high school students --whose main source of depression is parental/social-- to do whatever it takes to move out after high school.)At this point I am extremely insecure, have no self esteem nor self confidence, I am broke and have no friends.

It looked like in the movies when you see out of a characters eyes (or POV footage) and even now thinking back on it, it does not feel like it was me who walked out of the hospital.I lied and said that I was still drunk when I walked out, and the psychiatrist on duty gave me the option to be admitted or to go home.

No one even understands how bad it is I always get new weird symptoms that ruins my life every time. Its like just one argument will ruin everything and I cannot talk to them like I normally do.

One thing that stood out to me was a thought that humans are just biding our time here on Earth or something close to that. It was a very clear thought and gave me hope for anything after death for the first time. Maybe ever? I do not think I was suicidal then. Not really anyway. The thinking about death a lot part but not making any plans. Maybe a year or so after and for the past 5 years or so it has been off and on suicidal thoughts/plans. I guess my question is whether anyone else has thought about this before or after having suicidal thoughts. Or if you have had high thoughts that help you. Its a very small comfort to me.

My colleague and now somewhat close friend was worried about me working too much, but to be honest I do not mind it. That was until she made it clear I was really just living to work the past year. I recently made a promotion to a supervising position, but frankly, it does not do much to me. it is not that I miss my old work that much, but it just does not trigger anything inside of me. If anything, I am sort of left with a bittersweet feeling. This is just me in a nutshell. A 22 year old who had a normal upbringing who for some reason has no joy in life or a goal at all.

13245,"Over 12 years ago, I (M) had bad anxiety with random panic attacks. Depression was mixed in there as well probably due to the anxiety, they went hand in hand. I went to therapy and a psychiatrist. I was put on lexapro and the panc attacks stopped. I have since moved far away from those doctors, have not been to therapy in years. I just kept taking lexapro from my primary because why not. No one ever said to stop. But in the past year or two, my concentration has been getting worse and I felt other random little physical side effects from the medicine had just become annoying and thought why not stop lexapro, it is been years. I had to stop taking it before at one point due to moving and finding new doctor so I knew about withdrawals and I had to stop another couole prescriptions before lexapro was the one. I slowly lowered my dose every week or two for about a month or so. Eventually, I stopped and of course physical withdrawals came on, brain zaps and all. I stopped 4 weeks ago and the zaps stopped about a week ago. I have been less tired in the mornings which was a big struggle on lexapro, always tired. I have been overall feeling myself. But I am still having some mental things. I am still finding myself having random moments of depression. Just feeling hopelessness and thinking about the things I enjoy as a waste of time. I try to just work through it and tell myself it is temporary, thinking it could be the medication adjustment. The other weird thing is since I stopped the lexapro, I have had odd sexual side effects. Like decreased sensation, weaker orgasm, not lasting as long, etc. I have never had this on lexapro, only one I stopped completely. This is starting to bother me and I am thinking there is some permanent problem from 10+ years of lexapro.My main thing is, what do I do now? Is this still normal adjustments from coming off lexapro or an SSRI in general? I am not having panic attacks or bad anxiety which is why I took it years ago in the first place. Do I talk to a primary first? Should I try therapy? Go back on medication? Or go to a psychiatrist first? The problem is I have really crap insurance that only covers psychiatry and therapy through MD Live and I see mixed reviews on that so I keep getting put off from trying it. Also, not sure if a therapist or psyciatrist is who I should talk to about this.Maybe someone out here went through something similar.

Some people aka me are just unlovable. do not tell me I am.

I do not think anyone ever will. How do you tell someone you are seeing that you are essentially emotionally numb, when they reach out to you and tell you they are in a bad place? You say you have not felt emotionally in touch with things since before we met - it has made me feel worse - only reaffirming the aforementioned, I am not loveable. People use me at their convenience, I am the disposable friend, the therapist/bank of a daughter, the lonely and desperate fwb without the friends or benefits to me. I thought this person was different, I thought for a brief moment maybe I would found someone who actually wanted to be with me - not just in a relationship but someone who valued me as a person, someone who did not just convenient. The crushing realisation that this is not true is too much for me to handle. I just want to feel valued and loved. I feel such guilt for wanting to not be alive - so much of my life is where I know others only wish for it to be, I have achieved all the goals I have set out for myself - grades, volunteering, university - but at the cost of feeling so alone. I feel like nobody even my own family care. I feel like I am forever going to be on my own with these thoughts. It was almost a month of not saying to myself ""I want to die"" - I spent the month feeling anxious, of course, but the depressive thoughts had subsided - I thought I was getting better, happier - I thought I was beginning to cope. I am begining to realise, harshly, that these past few weeks were just mania - I am not better, and the realisation is so much worse. Being alive is beginning to hurt again. I am in a dark hole and just as I thought maybe I was getting out I have plunged deeper. I am thinking about antidepressants again, but I am scared last time I drank vodka on them and blacked out - but maybe they are my answer to these thoughts. I have began to fantasise about the logistics again, the how, when, and aftermath. The thoughts have already began forming a plan, I am literally on my own at uni nobody would know unless someone came looking for me but with the way things are I reckon it would a few days before anyone even began to look. It would be so easy, I would feel such relief I know it - but the guilt is too overwhelming, I feel guilty for potentially hurting people who are hurting me. Who are fueling the thoughts that drive me to want to die. The thoughts that make me self-harm. I am just so tired. I have spent the majority of my life fighting the urge to die.

34468,"Uncontrollable HIV anxiety New to Reddit so I apologise if this post is a little all over the place!

So I've struggled FOREVER with anxiety. I'm a 22 year old girl, whole jadda-jadda about troubled childhood, absent parents etc which I think has contributed to it. Over the past 3 weeks I have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that I have HIV. I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression in the past, as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that I'm on deaths door after panickingly Googling symptoms.

So basically I met a lovely guy, we really hit it off, going on lovely dates every day for about a week. Then, VERY out of character for me, we got drunk and slept together (every kind of sex, for those interested). I barely remember it and the next day I knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home, let alone anything else. Cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day, and I asked if he 'had anything'. He said no, and seemed pretty offended. Well, if he was offended by that, he was even more offended when I said I thought he had HIV and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? Where do you have them done? How many people have you slept with? 

I physically couldn't eat for days, and I spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. I was shaking constantly, waking up in the night in a hot sweat. In the end I spent 5 hours waiting in A&amp;E until 1am to get PEP. I had to exaggerate to get it (the guys parent's are Ghanaian and Nigerian, he was born in Cuba, but I said he was Ghanaian because I know there's a high rate there). I remember the doctor saying to me ""okay so there is some risk"" and I just started crying. I was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point.

The guy in question has been so lovely. He knew how anxious I was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. I'm currently taking PEP. All my friends think it's hilarious how anxious I am, but honestly this anxiety is killing me. I can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. I'll think things like, what if I've actually got it from a previous partner? This guy has tattoos, would they test for HIV before that? What if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before I find out the truth? 

I had a blood test done at the end of January which was clear, and my blood test from A&amp;E was fine, and I tested negative for everything except a water infection. Even then I was thinking what if the water infection is the start? I sneeze and convince myself these are the flu-like symptoms. I see a spot on my body and I'm convinced that is the rash starting. 

Does anyone else suffer with this? I'm scared that even if I get a negative result that my anxiety will continue. ",Anxiety

I hate it and most things in it. I try to like it, but I just do not. I do not want this life. I often wish that someone who thinks life is great would have been put here instead, or that Id die instead of these people who seem okay with life. I want out. Medication does not do shit, yes I tried it for a long time, therapy does not do shit and again, I tried it for years, getting out and doing things does not do shit, exercise does not do shit, I do not get those endorphins everyone talks about, I just get worn out.

Meditation is nice for a minute, but does nothing, and I am honestly sick of the mental gymnastics of all mindfulness things anyway. I do not like checking my thoughts all of the time.I am chronically ill and will just keep declining as I get older, I now have a chronic eye infection that is risking my vision.

People tell me too look at the bright side or be happy that I am not in a worse situation, but I do not like all of the bad in the world. That makes me sad.I feel like everything is so fake too, and I cannot stand fake. I do not like how relationships work either. Biologically I crave them, but they always leave me in so much pain. I feel like a lot of men do not want women anymore, they would rather jerk off at home to an e thot and play video games. They only want women for an emotional (or physical) punching bag. I do not think I am bad looking, and I keep my weight level. I try to be polite and have a listening ear, but it does not matter. We cannot compare to porn or digital pleasures.

Title pretty much says it all. I have been having a really bad time with my mental health, I am trying my best to navigate it in life but it is very hard. I have done therapy and medications for years to alleviate the symptoms. My bf also has had extensive experience with his own mental health struggles so he is no stranger to it. My boyfriend is my rock, and has been for the 4ish years we have been together. he is helped me through a lot, and I have supported him through tough times too. We got engaged 1 year ago. he is the most important person present in my life, I do not have many people I trust. However, this time around my mental state has been possibly worse than it is ever been since we have been together. The last month it is caused a big rift and lots of arguments. I have barely had the energy to look after myself, and work is demanding for me when I can manage to go. My bf works a lot more than me, and always needs some attention or something for us to do together after a long day. He supports us a lot right now financially so of course I try my best to put in effort. But there are days I cannot manage to do anything at all besides lay in bed or stare into a book instead of focusing on the outer world around me, and he when that happens he gets upset that I do not give him attention or sit next to him on the couch while he watches t.v. at least. I have explained to him over and over, I am dealing with stuff, literally going day by day to try and not kill myself. But it always circles back to, what about HIS needs? What did he do to make me feel so bad? Did I talk to someone that triggered stuff, or did something happen to make the world fall apart??? What about all he does for me? Why am I not paying attention to him? Am I not grateful? All of this ultimately boils down to our past with issues of commitment, and the grand question of; Am I going to leave him?? I am trying my best to look after the needs of the relationship but I also need to focus on myself a bit more and my life outside of our relationship to try to not end up hanging myself.... is that so bad?? it is so exhausting... can I not be upset or have a bad day without it totally affecting him as well? I feel guilty for feeling like shit lately. Sometimes I think I should just leave so that he will go to therapy and become better for himself, I do not know if that is what I want or if that is my depression talking...

47474,"So tired of being the person laughed at and not taken seriously. I'm a bit of an introvert but through the years I learned to appear social and outgoing with people. In most contexts it's positive and useful. But in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person. 

I sometimes make jokes about memes, funny videos, etc. It's a good way to engage with other people at work for example. Rest of the people do the same. It's not that I'm joking more than the rest of the people. 

I never make jokes about the others, I'm very respectful. I even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people. 

Yet there's always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me. For example, now people at work make fun about my poor diet. I never detailed anything about what I eat, or if I had time to cook. And some of those people bring canned food. Or about some of my habits. When stuff like this starts happening, I feel really hurt. It's like I thought for a long time I was sharing funny moments with workmates, and actually everybody was clowning me. 

There are some ridiculous things about me. My voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age (37) and that would be a main thing. I'm gay and that makes it even more obvious, but I don't talk about my sexuality since it's private. 

I wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually I'm being friendly like the others. 

However I no longer care. Once I get fed up with all this, I avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me. I would consider to say what I wrote here in a polite way, but it's impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person. 

 So I've decided to not eat again with this people, just go outside or stay on my own. Not the first time it happens to me, but the first where i can just avoid it easily.

I'm in a pretty bad state right now. For the last 2 days I've been having really big and sometimes debilitating pain in my abdomen area.

Phoned 111 and they recommended I go to the local A&amp;E. The blood test was fine and the doctor said he doesn't think it's appendicitis.

51200,"How does one with AvPD even begin to entertain the idea of being in a romantic relationship? To me the idea of being in a relationship like that is the ultimate danger as the level of intimacy in that dynamic is as high as it can possibly be in life. It is just hard to comprehend myself being able to deal with something like that because the fear is overwhelming.  For this reason this is one of the hardest things for me to work on despite making inroads in other respects.

I have learned to personally engage with people in a platonic way, although I have a sort of mental dissonance that keeps most social interactions at a superficial level.  But it seems like that is not a possibility with romance, which is why I have not been able to adapt or understand how to even go about it.  This is why like many other posts I have come across on here, I have virtually no experience at 27.

I'm wondering how others have even begun to be able to make an effort to seek one or even be in one as the possibility of rejection and having to be emotionally open is amplified.  I realize that avpd obviously is an individualized experience and other social dynamics might be more difficult for others and this is not me saying that I believe those in relationships are lying about their diagnosis of course.

15251,"For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we have lost interest in caring for ourselves.there is no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?I have grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just do not care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely do not see one for myself and I am not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.This has to be the worst part about being depressed. it is an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens.

46093,"(Brief Mention of Self Harm) How can I help my friend? I apologize if I am posting this in the wrong place, please let me know and I’ll move it!

I’ve had a friend (M) for quite a few years that suffers from bipolar disorder. M didn’t tell me about it until a good couple years into the friendship; they were in the midst of an episode, and I (not knowing what was really going on) regrettably lashed out because I didn’t understand why they had been constantly upset and irritable with me.  After that, we had a much better understanding and M did a great job of redirecting their anger so I wasn’t getting the brunt of it. However, they’ve been under quite a bit of stress lately, and although they are not usually directly lashing out at me, they’ve taken an emotional turn for the worse. M seems to be in a constant state of negativity, always turning every small difference of opinion into an argument, and going on angry rants about it. It feels like every time I talk about anything, they always have a negative rebuttal. They’ve become very reclusive, so we hardly ever go out anymore, if I suggest events or concerts or outings, they don’t want to go, and can only think about why it’d be a bad time. If something goes wrong, their night/mood is ruined (for example, if they didn’t want pickles on their sandwich and got pickles, rather than take them off, M just throws it away, doesn’t eat, and remains livid about the fact they didn’t get to eat, and eventually leaves for home early because they’re so upset). Our friend group usually gathers at my place, so at this point it’s like I’m trying to tip toe around broken glass in my own home, lest I say something to upset them.  Lastly, the most worrisome thing to me is that they will sometimes joke about how they got so angry they punched their arm/leg/bedroom wall/etc., and the damage is visible. 

They are currently on medication (from what I’ve witnessed mostly just helps more with the mania) and see a psychiatrist pretty regularly, but they don’t see a therapist (though they’ve admitted they could probably benefit from one).  I want to be a better friend to them, but I myself struggle with depression and it makes that difficult at times. 

I guess I’m asking for advice because I don’t know how to approach a conversation about this behavior. My worst fear is that M will misunderstand my intentions. They are my best friend, and I’d do anything for them, but the friendship is starting to take a mental toll on me as well. ",Bipolar

I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times.

I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her.

I changed psychiatric care providers and during my intake appointment the APRN suggested medical marijuana. They told me it would increase the efficacy of the stimulant and mood stabilizer I am on. They also claimed they would be able to replace the benzos I dislike taking.

My childhood was absolutely difficult but I don't really see how it would result in PTSD (the only psychiatric condition that medical marijuana is approved for in my state)

They treat me like a third party of their marriage as the oldest daughter which means I am loaded with all their problems while witnessing my dysfunctional family at the same time. My mom always says that if something ever happens to us (her kids) she will finally divorce my father (who absolutely will not do it) and ever since I have been calculating the results. I mean it is kind of of a win for all of us, I will rest, mom will finally get her divorce, my siblings will live for once in a healthy environment, and father will go his own way .. they would be sad for a while i guess, but really that is the only bad side to it.

52976,"My mom doesn’t care anymore I (24M) have been dealing with anxiety and treatment resistant depression for the past few years or so. It’s gotten very bad and my mental health has deteriorated as the days go on. I’ve started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and it’s really freaked me out lately. I’ve been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.

The past few months have been hell, dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues, and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. I’m surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable, talking to a different guy every night and most nights she’s going out. Now this probably wouldn’t bother me but when I have so much going on, sometimes I just need someone to talk to. 

I was always extremely close to my mom, she has always been there for me but lately she really doesn’t even seem to care. Her only worry is that “I’m afraid you’re going to hurt yourself” but she doesn’t want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and I’m so hurt. I’ve lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.

I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house, I workout so it’s not like I’m just sitting at home waiting for her. But you can’t even have a conversation with her without her staring at her phone. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it and I can’t imagine losing my parents emotionally. I’m at a loss.",Anxiety

34280,"freaking out about dvt!!! Hi all. i literally just found this reddit 20 minutes and, im already. extremely thankful for it, I've suffered with bouts of health anxiety on and off for years and its been one of the most soul crushing things to experience in my life. Lately since I got a big job my anxiety has latched back to my health again because it constantly needs to focus on something with me. I'm a massive worrier in general, its terrible but Im trying my best all the time. a few months ago it hyper fixated on blood clots on my legs and DVT thus causing like intense leg pains and what not i think after months of just fixating on it (and also developing a real actual flu that was debilitating and not from my hell brain I just wore it out of my brain which is cool i guess. except not really because I've recently developed a lump in my neck (most likely frm flu). its painless goes from feeling tender to firm but it swims around a little on my neck and goes from unnoticeable to like really noticeable. what has me freaking out though is that its on top of an artery, we went to the er after i had one really bad freak out and managed to at least get a nurse to check it (we would have stuck around for the doctor but it was like 1am and we would have had to wait til like 5 am. also my mom kind of started giving me flack on all of this bc she's extremely impatient on my hypochondria and really horrible about it) who took my blood pressure and kinda felt it , she assumes its a lymph node and i know a nurse isnt a doctor but im trying my best to be rational in that ok maybe she is right because nurses do experience a lot of shit with patients and should be pretty well versed on things. but idk its been  like 2 weeks and its still there and my brain is just. in literal hell . im just freaking out that every day is my last and i just have  clot hanging out there even though its like painless and not red or like super hot to touch and in like like the next 20 minutes i mgonna just endure a stroke or something and my brain is fried enough as is so im not even processing thoughts properly or anything. also w hypochondria since im like still googling shit on what it may be!!! im starting to endure what im assuming is sensations im  making up like pains in my neck whatever. but im also like paranoid that im actually right on all of this because this is the most real physical thing ive experienced i guess with my hypochondria. also ive seen some stuff with swollen things in necks with cancer and at this point im just trying to not even look into that because i think i'll literally have another break down, im sorry i guess, i just needed to vent somewhere where others would get what im experiencing because at home its been very much condescending and dismissive and i feel extremely trapped and upset. I'd love to go back to the doctors again myself but I have really bad agoraphobia as well and due to how condescending my folks have been with me i feel extremely embarrassed/ashamed/upset on any of my emotions on all of this and how much im fixating. its just really scary and im just really sad at this point. anyway thank you for reading this if you do and being patient with me if you respond",Anxiety

35148,"Rabies Scare So I came upon a branch that had some porcupine quills embedded in it, and was stupid enough to pull a few out to get a better look. A managed to poke myself in the finger with one - it didn't go very deep (no blood) and I pulled it out right away.

Anxiety reared its head and I was suddenly worried about exposure to rabies. I did call urgent care to see what they said. They didn't know the answer right away and had to do a bit of research. The verdict that came back was ""porcupines don't carry rabies, so you should be fine."" 

I wasn't particularly confident in this assessment since porcupines can like most mammals carry and transmit rabies. I'm wondering if she was just referring to the quills.

Any way I'm still kind of freaking out - Rabies does not seem like a fun way to go.

Please know there is nothing you can or could do.I am jealous of people in mental wealth wards. that is where I want to be.

I am on 100mg of sertraline and all it is done is made me more anxious and I cannot even enjoy music anymore. I cannot cry anymore, I cannot laugh anymore, I cannot cum anymore (TMI I know).

They will not be out all night though, and will probably return at 10 or 10:30pm.

At least then they will probably take me seriously and throw me in a ward where I belong.And yeah I am posting this for attention. Do I want pity? Yeah, probably.

I have graduated from a university last year , but have yet to find myself a job due to this unknown sickness. It happens whenever I get emotional or under a hot temperature, my body will just overheat and causes immense unbearable psychological pain ( burning ,needle and itching sensation). I have no idea how to get rid of it , the only instant solution to this is by taking a cold and ice bath , but that is impossible if you are outdoor , and I can only rely on a water spray to minimize the pain and keep my body slightly cool. Sadly that does not help much either , since it is hard to spray under your clothing in public, and the ""partly hot partly cold and wet feelings"" just make it even worse.This has kept me from doing any kind of activities and even leaving my room , I have been telling my parents about this since 3 years ago , but they did not take it seriously and all they cared are whether I get my degree or not. Although they did not force me into finding a job after I have graduated , they still proceeded to ignore my issue and feelings , because according to their logic, they think I am just overly stressed and needed some time off , and while some part of this is true , what i really needed are some medical advice and treatment , yet they just remains silent everytime I bring this up, or just shift the topic to job seeking and how tolerable they are for ""allowing me"" to take an year off . what is worse is my dad is a doctor and my mom is a former nurse...And here I am , being a shut in everyday because it hurts going outside. Yes I know this is not a permanent solution and I cannot stay like this forever , but what can i do ?

18948,"Since I(31) have been born, I failed in establishing myself successfully in lifes most important factors (at least for my health): work, friendship, and love. Despite learning more than the average student, I always wrote bad grades. I barely passed high school. Beside that I was always mocked in school. I do not recall having one friend. I remember being always nice to people, but somehow, they found me boring. One time I managed to get invited to a new years eve party. When I showed up at the location agreed, nobody was there. I later found out, that they tricked me for fun in to showing up despite they do not want to hang out with me. This is one example of dozens being mocked by my peers.However, I managed to survive school without friends and started motivated into my twenties. I worked my ass off to save up money for college, since its basically impossible to get a good job without a college degree where I live. At 25 I had saved up enough money to finance this. Like in school I could not manage to write good enough exams to stay in college. Within four/five years I failed twice my classes, which led to dropping out of college after five years, since I could not finance it anymore. The only job I could find now, was a minimum wage position. I am doing over hours as a cashier at a fast food chain to make ends meet. This situation drives me insane. I worked many years to save for college to just lost all money I had and get nothing back in return. Besides that and never having many friends, I never experienced the slightest amount of romantical intimacy. Because of that I suffer from a terrific lack in this basic need. The worst thing about this, is knowing that the reason for my chronical rejection. I am just that unattractive. Why: I have basically tried everything to make a date happen over the last decade. I signed up on multiple dating sites, I asked out women directly, I joined single meetups. Nothing worked. Almost every women rejected me. That a woman once showed interest in me, never happened. Like every lack in a need, this lack starts to affect my mental resp. physical health negatively. The longer I have been rejected the more I suffered from symptom of this involuntary celibacy. I suffer from panic attacks, insomnia, depression and so on.And I know these symptoms occur because of this situation because whenever I made a small progress in this need like having a date or being touched in this context by a woman, these symptoms disappeared. Beside the obvious things like sex, kisses or relationships, I miss out all the social encounters within dating, since I am already getting cut off for a date. I never talk to a women, I never get messaged, I can never message a women. Here I am. With nothing and nobody. Poor. Sick. Every women rejects me. I do not know how I should continue living this life without anything of these things. I am going insane. I am basically the man no women wants. How can I accept that? People complained about not being able to date during covid. I am living this Nightmare for 31 years. What should I do mean? When nothing in life turns out right",Suicidal

I used to tell myself it is my parents fault; they ruined me, that is why I cannot do it, but who cares?I feel like I have been dying for at least 6 years now. My dad attempted suicide when I was young, and successfully commit suicide a few years ago. He was never the same after he lost his job two years before attempting suicide for the first time, and he was never able to hold down a job since, except for work as a Uber driver for the last year of his life. I grew up believing that even if you tried your best, you were bound to fail, so why try? My dad tried hard, he was educated with multiple degrees, and he failed. There was so many humiliating moments in my life where he would beg for money in front of me, and sometimes even using me to beg. He would sing along to Bruno Mars' ""I Want to be a Billionaire"" in the car, threw a temper tantrum to my aunts and uncles demanding the bonus money one of my uncle's received because he was his former coworker before he was fired, had screaming fits of rage when my uncle and cousin did not loan him money he needed, brought my brother and I along to ask some guy of our ethnicity for a financial favor, etc. I believed every excuse he made when he quit working somewhere. I believed I could never do it, and I hated how my parents acted like I could. After all, I was ""just like my dad"", as my mom would say.I barely passed high school. I think all throughout high school, I never studied once, except maybe some French vocabulary once in awhile. I never studied after high school, either. I hated how my family treated me like some genius because I wrote bad poetry in middle school; they never knew what my actual grades were like. I thought I was going to kill myself by age 18 anyway, so high school did not matter. All I cared about in high school was friends, which I did not really have. I had two friends from middle school that went to other high schools, and I was not allowed to see them for the most part. I saw them a handful of times throughout high school, after months or years of begging. My parents never let me leave the house, not even for walks. Why? For my ""safety"", which they never actually cared about. The real reason was because only ""bad girls"" did that, according to my mom. ""Bad girls"" are her word for ""whores"". She would call little girls playing in their front yards ""bad girls"", and teenage girls out walking together ""bad girls"". I was so desperate to be away from my parents, that I would go on walks alone near my school just to not go home. There was nothing much to see, and no one to spend time with; I just could not stand my life of school and home, school and home. School where I would be alone at lunch, and home where I would be alone and have to listen to my parents screaming fits.I never thought my family of aunts and uncles and cousins loved each other; I thought it was all just a fake performance, because that is how my mom would treat it. I would finally allow myself to relax around my family, and then I would notice my mom glowering at me with complete and utter hate, whispering hateful words toward me. After the family gathering, she would tell me what terrible crimes I committed on the way home: not making enough eye contact, not saying hello properly, acting like a ""freak"". She was just trying to help me, of course. I just did not realize how much I was embarrassing myself, after all.I also needed to realize how much I was embarrassing myself by thinking people actually wanted to spend time with me, too. One time I lied about getting tutoring so I could spend an hour after school with an acquaintance. My parents cut my time with her short by lying about calling the police. Around the time, my mom asked me I really thought people wanted to be around me, and told me I am embarrassing myself ""going after people"". She did the same thing when, after several years of begging, she let me visit my friend at age 17 whom I had known since middle school and who lived only a few minutes drive away, for an hour. It felt so good, I did not want to leave. I ignored my mom's texts for maybe 20 minutes, and again, she lied about having called the police and telling them that my friend was a rape victim. She spat in my face and locked me out of the house at night... why? Because I worried her so much, and I ""did not even look like I was sorry"".I attempted suicide when I was 17. In the psychiatric hospital, my mom humiliated me by openly wondering if maybe I did it because of my acne. But still, I was not as hopelessly sad as I am now. Maybe I would have been able to be a normal person, if it were not for what happened when I was 18. I was raped by an almost-stranger who worked at my community college, and made the mistake of telling one of my cousins. She had felt guilty for excluding me from her friendship circle with my other cousins, and had told me that she would be there for me after she learned about the attempted suicide when I was 17. So I told her, and she told her dad and then ignored me. Her dad told my other uncle, and then they told my parents. My family is religious, and they blamed me, except for my dad. That was the worst time of my life. I was forced to tell the police, who asked me questions about if I was a virgin before and how many times did I have sex. I received letters from the community college saying it was likely consensual, and the guy never lost his job. I checked his Facebook a couple months ago, and he is doing just great. My mom severely emotionally abused me for the incident ever since. My dad, who my uncles call the best father because whereas they would have disowned me, he did not... forced me to go to that same community college everyday until the end of the semester. Because he cared about my future, of course. And I guess my safety too. I have this distinct memory of me being desperate to leave my front door, just for a walk on a sunny day. He physically held me back, saying ""it is not safe"". But I guess I was safe going there everyday, and I could definitely do well too, right? No. I muddled along for the next two years, not doing anything of substance, and then my dad commit suicide.I think I got over the bereavement stage of my dad's suicide very quickly. He was very loving, but that is not good enough for me. I was always, always uncomfortable around him. He was severely mentally ill, and I took the brunt of it. ""The best dad"" would not have strangled me for not drinking enough water for his liking. He felt love for me, sure, and I knew that, but he was never able to express it properly. That will never be good enough for me. My mom then spent several months blaming me for it, saying that my dad did it because he ""knew"" my rape was actually consensual, etc.At the age of 21, I finally transferred from community college to university, despite only having done 58 of the required 60 units, not even enough to apply for an associate's degree. I thought maybe my life could finally improve... but it did not. I am still the same directionless, lazy piece of shit. I flunked all of my classes, and now I am taking a semester off, but I will probably disenroll from university entirely. My bank account will likely be closed in two days, because I have had a negative balance for two months. Instead of getting a job, I ignored the issue, expecting my mom to pick up the pieces. But I am 22 and she is tired of having to take care of me. I do not even resent her for it, her being emotionally abusive is not an excuse for me to be a parasite. Other people are motivated by emotional abuse to escape their situation, for me all I do is sit and cry about it.So much other shit happened to me, it would just be too long to write it all... I only wrote what I did to explain most of the reasons why I am depressed, but now, my whole debt issue and failure at everything is my main issue. I am afraid. I had an interview today, but I rescheduled it, because I am afraid. I never grew up and I do not want to, I just want to disappear. I have been waiting for someone to save me I guess, someone to take care of me like I feel I need to be taken care of, but I will not even be taken care of financially anymore. I am 22, in debt, have never worked a real job, do not have a driver's license, and am a soon to be college dropout",Depression
26020,"I am 23(m) and I have been dealing with depression since I was 14 (that was when I was diagnosed) and anxiety since I was 3 (separation anxiety from 3-8, social anxiety since)TLDR: Read the last large paragraph, I do not know how I can condense it more than thatWhen I was 3 my parents broke up, I was always close to my mum and to my dad I was more of an object to be owned than his son, but because he believed he deserved to have me he fought my mum for me. I know he did not care because I anytime I was with him I was put aside and never really interacted with and when I did not want to go with him he would pry my off a lamppost while I was crying and drag me to the car to take me to his house. All of this is what brought the first sembalances of my anxiety and low self esteem because if my own blood does not really love me then I took it as there was something wrong with me. And to top it off he cheated on my mum which is why they broke up and he did it before and after they were together with other women.After that my mum remarried and her next partner was fine at first but he changed when they had my younger brother. After that I was treated as a hindrance and due to the troubles of on going custody and court stuff my dad was causing during there relationship, my mum's partner saw me as my father's son and took out his frustrations on me in the first of gas lighting and mental abuse. This went on from when I was 5 till 17. He also mentally abused my mum and older sister but my little brother had an illness and my mum felt she had to stay for him. Only when he was older did she leave him and thus I was freed from his abuse.I also had an accident when I was 14 and fractured my hip, I could not walk on it at all for a year and could use partial weight only a year after that. That was the final straw for me and made me deeply depressed because the one place I could get away to was school and after not being there for months I felt alienated and alone. I am the end I just retreated to my room as that was the only place I had some semblance of safety left.All this is what has led to my deep rooted self hatred, low self worth, anxiety and depression. Since all of that all I have managed to do is idly spend my time retreating into games and barely really living. To top it all off the last 2 friends I had completely distanced themselves from me because of a difference of views and now I have no one but my mum and my siblings. Even my grandparents who always were there for me have dementia and cannot even remember me when they see me.I just feel so alone and that everyone will leave me one day And when they do there will be no reason left for me to live, even now I feel that it would be better if I just died now and saved the trouble of my family having to support me while I leech off their kindness. I do not want to be a burden but I feel so useless and I know how lazy I am and hate myself for it. I just do not know if there is a way out of the mess in my head and to live a life worth living.I am sorry if this has been extremely long and too much, I just wanted to say something somewhere to relieve the feeling built up inside 23(m) Just need to get how I feel off my chest as I have no one I can talk to",Depression

I have never stopped living for my parents. I have had few friends, and none that lasted. I have had no relationships. I am isolated and afraid. I do not think I am going to last much longer like this, without falling apart. I have been depressed since I learned what sexual abuse was. it is isolating, to hear someone prattle on about something you know from experience, and warn against it like you have a choice about whether to be abused. To look around the room, and see frightened, amused, or curious faces, but not see anyone else looking around. No one else that might be wondering if they are the only ones that already experienced this. I do not want to get into my bad behaviors, just know they are destructive and ruining my life. And escalating. I feel like there is a part of me that is trying to break free, and it is dangerous. it is caused very dangerous situations in my life. it is all been so much worse, since last year. My mom died, and despite everything, I still loved her. I was the only one present when she died. I saw her face, and watched life leave her eyes. I am haunted to this day by that picture.

18691,"4 years ago I dropped 70 pounds by starving myself in relation to a depression and medication induced lack of appetite. When I saw the weight start to come off, I just kept it going. Very unhealthy way to do it, but I felt satisfied with myself for the first time ever. But over the last 3 years the weight has gradually started to come back with various influencing factors. Every time I have started the process to attempt to get healthy in a safe way, inevitably a new depressive episode hits and my ability to do simple tasks tanks and I am left in survival mode and not caring about what or how much I put into my body. I fear going home. I fear going back to school this semester for the simple reason that my primary instructor felt the need to point out my weight a few weeks ago. Now, I have not gained all of it back, but definitely a significant portion. And yet, why is that her business? Why should she point it out as if it had any bearing on my scholastic ability?Anyways, I guess I just wanted to get this out. I am finally in a decent place mentally after tanking in January. I have caught up on very old dishes, did my laundry, and generally cleaned, and decluttered my apartment. I have been grocery shopping and meal prepping for the past week and making commitments to physical activity by investing in equipment for my home and taking Karate lessons.I feel like I can do it, but I am impatient and the anxiety of the realistic timeline for results against the timeline for the return to university has me second guessing every moment. But every moment I keep choosing to take care of myself even if it does not show to anyone else. yet. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

46607,"needing validation ive never posted on this subreddit before because i am not officially diagnosed bipolar, but i went from MDD to an unspecified mood disorder in less than a year. some bg: im a college sophomore. the first time i ever went to therapy was march of last year. i started lamictal in december. growing up mental illness was just not a thing to my parents, so i never saw any doctor or pdoc.

basically, ive had to do and learn everything myself regarding mental illness and treatment. but i think im reaching a burnout. the lamictal is great, however my focus issues, which ill just address as ADHD (i have vivid memories of almost never sleeping during pre-school nap time and instead lifting up our bed mats with my legs, and ive heard my mom say she has it) are still something i don't have treatment for.


not being diagnosed with anything as a kid has made this journey incredibly difficult, especially concering ADHD. while ive improved drastically since freshman year (i had a debilitating depressive episode where i ended up with a 0.8 GPA), i haven't made progress with the ADHD. last friday i went to an ADHD screening for testing at my school's psych services office as im required to have the school's insurance anyways. it was the most discouraging experience.

i told the woman that ive had focus issues and homework issues for as long as i can remember.  i told her exactly what my thoughts would be like in a class, my horrible sleep quality, my difficulties around getting my work done, etc. i talked to her about the very recent development regarding my mood disorder.

she told me that she thinks what i was describing is related to other issues, which were ""out of their scope"" and recommended me to a doctor who has a semester long waitlist for full psychological testing. which would be at least $400, $4,000 if i didnt have insurance. 

last semester i dealt with ADHD by meeting with a professor every week to go over assignments. i got accommodations from a few classes even without being registered with disability services. however, that's not 100% the case with all my classes this semester. i was struggling before that screening but now im struggling even more. i have a test tomorrow morning i have not studied for, not to mention i did not do at all an essay assignment, and i havent done the workbook pages due by the test. i had to ask for an extension for a paper in another class the night before because i hadn't even written it. ive missed meetings and work.

that friday night i tried to find coke. sunday night i took 5 shots at 1am. monday i bought adderall and took 3/4 of it, and ive never taken adderall before. i have not done anything but stay in bed because the thought of even trying to tackle my immense amount of work is so overwhelming. 

i know it takes a while to get a diagnosis but like i said, i am feeling so burnt out. how many more doctors do i have to see? how many more episodes do i have to go through and other self-destructive behaviour? my family is no help either, my father threatened to not pay my tuition when he found out i was taking meds and refused to tell him. the rest are just invalidating. 

i don't know what to do or figure out what i need to find out. i am so tired of not having anything. my chest literally hurts and im curled up in bed in the dark crying. im sorry this is so long but ive never had the chance or resource to really talk about this stuff honestly that im just letting it all out now. im just desperate for some reassurance and validation at the very least.",Bipolar

It helped me stay less depressed, distract myself and in times it even helped me get work done when I could not get myself to do it sober.

I'm a 23-year-old female, non-smoker, otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though, I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.

She referred me for an MRI with contrast, and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better, anyway (I did.) I haven't had that yet, but I'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else I should be concerned with or if I should take her advice to just chill. I've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before (12 at a time, two years ago, apparently caused by stress), I wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and I had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. They were more impacted on that side of my mouth. I'm not sure what to do, just wondering if I'm going crazy or if I'm right to be concerned. Also, I'm more short of breath lately (not like, short of breath in a way where I'm sweaty and my heart's beating fast. Short of breath like my throat feels tight.)

34369,"Heart anxiety for no reason Hello all,

First post on here, there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. 

I just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. I am anxious about having a heart issue, every day, and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. There's no family history, I'm relatively young (32), have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found, my cholesterol is fine, and I can do mild exercise with no pain (I'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so I'm at a mild level). I threw away my blood pressure monitor because I think it was feeding my anxiety but when I used to take it, it was always in the normal range. 

But every day, I'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. Sometimes when I'm lying on my side, and in certain positions on the sofa. Sometimes I'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. Or I'll feel my heart beat normally, then seem to stop, then thump back into rhythm. My partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me, it feels like it's thumping and missing beats.

When I get any of those sensations, I'll worry about what it means and I'll feel panicky, especially if I'm on my own, or in a situation that I can't escape from, such as a plane or recently, on the London Eye ferris wheel. Maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. The current snow in England is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me.

Along with those weird heart sensations, I'll get chest discomfort, like a heavy indigestion feeling, sometimes odd feelings in my arm, sometimes light headed feelings. None of it is painful, it's just like weird sensations. 

I've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and I've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far, it hasn't made much difference.

I don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether I'm literally doing it all to myself.

I'm not an anxious person normally. I can talk in public, I'm not socially anxious at all, it seems to be this one and only issue and I've no idea where it came from. 

Does anyone else get these feelings, and if so, how do you ignore them and how have you managed to reduce them? ",Anxiety

49901,"Hypomania/mania doubt Does anyone ever feel like their hypomania or mania isn’t that bad, when in reality it is? I’m always questioning my diagnosis because I feel like my mania isn’t even half as bad as some things I read. Or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. Recently it’s been getting worse, as I’ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. For example, I had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. And I was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling, but then I was scared that I would continue to lean and lean until I got the urge to jump off. Same thing happened when I crossed a bridge except I did end up leaning into it. But before this episode, my mania was only feeling really confident, or believing I had superpowers, or paranoia that everyone was looking at me, and my irritation was really bad. Like I was screaming at my computer today. Just wanna know if anyone also thinks their not bipolar because their mania isn’t even half as bad as they read some peoples experiences",Bipolar
11747,Hey guys I do not normally do not write stuff ever. Basically I have been suicidal since I was like idk 5 and now I am 18. I have probably been suicidal in the back of my mind 60% of the time since then and super suicidal like 40% of the time. Nobody rly knows I am depressed to the level I am. A few of my closer friends know I am on anti depressants but that is about it. I would not appear depressed to the average person. I try and be super positive like I do rlly nice things for homeless people not just donate stuff like actually sit down and talk and make them feel human. I have a great heart I just idk. I am tired. Lots of people would say I am really pretty and self hatred aside I am above average for sure. The only reason I have not killed myself is because I am scared of pain and/or surviving and living a worse life than usual. I have big dreams and would love to live life I just would rather be dead to be honest. I work hard I have 2 jobs my own apartment and my grades in high school were good. I just cannot shake this feeling. I think I just felt so alone for so long and hated on myself in my head so fuckint hard for so long it permanently messed up my brain. I love but also hate myself. I either look In the mirror and take a bunch of cute pics or if I can even get myself to look in the mirror Ill feel nauseous and feel like I am shutting down and then disassociate and think of ways to kill myself. I do not even know why I am writing this now I guess just to see if anyone relates. I think it bothers me that people do not take my depression seriously because I am pretty and nice . Not sure.

I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt, she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor, he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option, we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family, no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this.

While the main personality doesn’t remember at all or is forced to be in the back. I’m conscious and can “control” each one of them, I can basically bite my tongue before bad things happen.

I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failure/coward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and I was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent.

I used to think everyone had some good in them i was wrong. I used to volunteer and help people in need be i have been used and exploited so much I am done. I genuinely am done but I am to afraid to end my life. I was so kind to people i have been told so many times i am the nicest person ever by some people.

13820,"Warning: this is long. I am basically describing all my problems. I am 23. I am supposed to have finished my first year at this really good law school. I have told everyone that I am. Instead, I have actually been a graduate student with my masters in legal science at a less reputed college near me, while actually applying now. I have lied to everyone. I left my hometown to go to law school. I moved into an apartment with my high school/college bestie. She works a LOT as an engineer. Moving in with her was a great idea, I do not regret it and I still love her. she is a good roommate, but honestly she just talks a LOT about herself and her life, I feel like she never asks me. I am also very good at deflecting but I wish she would push a little harder to ask how I am. So I tend to avoid her and chill in my room a lot. I also need time to relax. I also smoke weed almost every day and lie about it. I have a vaping problem that is so hard to quit but I am trying. I lost my gramps earlier this year and its been difficult because he was my favorite man on this planet.I was diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder, bordering depression. Was also prescribed medication I never kept up with. I was going to my psychiatrist then she moved to a different clinic that did not take my insurance. Its been like 6 months since and I still have not gone to another. here is the issue that I think triggered me to become the asshole. My cousin had this graduation extravaganza party. I did a lot, I worked a lot, I fucking cleaned up vomit and managed t o send 30 teenagers home after 1am and ubers were closed. I worked my ass off and just never felt appreciated through the whole moment. Even worse I feel like I annoyed everyone. So, it triggered me real bad and I pushed away everyone. Now I am stuck with no one I can talk to. I have some really good friends I just completely stopped talking to. By the time I realized Id pushed everyone away and stopped talking, I could not figure out how to respond and they all STILL to this day have been trying to get me to talk to them. But a group of friends (two of whom I stopped talking to and the rest people I was t close with) and I had planned a trip months ago. The hotel reservation was under my name and I had a discount. If I did not go, they would not be able to stay there. So I went, felt like everyone hated me the whole trip. The last day was super bad and I cried many times secretly through the day in the bathrooms lmao. Then, I got super wasted and cried for hours in front of 3 of them. No one cared to really talk to me because we had a 9 hour drive that day. So, right before that trip I was ready to apologize to all my friends. Then the trip happened and I no longer really want to talk to anyone. I am not suicidal, I just do not want to live. The only reason I am still on this planet is my mom. I could never kill myself because I cannot fail her. But I imagine myself dying or getting cancer all the time. I do not want to do anything, I have lost passion is everything. I know I am for real depressed. I lie about EVERYTHING because I do not want anyone to think negatively about me bc I already have severe body image issues and I cannot stand to let others thinks there is more wrong with me besides the fact that I am clinically obese. I push everything off. I am pretty sure I have a rotting tooth that could probably get infected and kill me at any time but I have not gone to the dentist because I do not have the energy and now I am scared and also I do not want to. I need to know if I am an asshole to my friends but also advice on how to get out of this rut. In the last 3 days, I have not been smoking, I have not been vaping. I go to coffee shops and work super hard on my applications (also helps that I have some left over ADHD meds.) I finally started to feel some hope and light.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact (liking stories, pics,etc). Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know (crazy I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music, middle fingers in pictures, etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought, does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do.

I have an eating problem and I binge eat a lot and I keep the food wrappers in my room because I am embarrassed and don’t want my parents to find out about the binging...

Woke up at 4am and saw a mouse on my bedroom floor and there is always more than one. Must have been attracted by the food wrappers. Told my parents and they are angry but I told them it was wrappers from Christmas chocolate not binge food. I’ll die of embarrassment if they find out, which they will, because all the wrappers are in a bin bag in my room. 

So the mice are going to be horribly killed and my parents are going to be so angry with me and it is all my fault and I feel so guilty. This happened when I was around fourteen for the same reason - I am now 22 - and oh god why the hell haven’t I grown out of this pathetic crap.

Happiness is self progression, that you find out miraculously so random, poor does not become happy rich, becomes happy when it found its way to move forward. What makes you happy is not what you get, but road you went through. Makes you proud and self confident.

24464,"Hi all, in my short 19 years on this earth I have been through many trials and triumphs but my life seems to be getting progressively worse and I have not had the best life I ever and already feel like I have lived a lifetime worth of experiences due to the trauma I have experienced in my life like: sexual, emotional, physical abuse, stabbed someone when I was 17 and attacked them with mallet due to bullying, being involved with a police chase, surviving car accident, being a addict and addicted to alcohol at age 17 until last (year age 19),being deaf in left ear from birth, survived surgery, survived many illness and infection as a young child, and being revived at birth due to oxygen loss, severe bullying, I have had around 50-60 suicidal episodes last year and have had many more prior. I managed to obtain my NCEA Lvl 1,2,3 even though I was kicked out of school due to being sevely bullied and having everyone hate me, I have had many fun sexual experiences, done some pretty crazy and one of a kind stuff, seen and done things alot of people could ever do etc. I always made sure to live every day as if it was my last and live fearless so I have lived my life on the edge and to the fullest although I was lonely and sad alot of it due to anxiety and past trauma. But things were starting to look up around last year I acquired a good job and a wonderful partner S.C. ironically I had my car accident 15mins after I dropped her off at a friend's place as she stayed at mine and we had only met in person the night before. But our relationship prospered and that crash made me become clean from alcohol and drugs because of the thought of her and prospect of career and family I have always wanted to raise children and live on a farm in the countryside etc. But... My life has changed for the worst now=Initially my illness started about 1am on Jan 18th 2021 after I awoke from a vivid nightmare drenched in sweat then I had an auditory hallucination and diahorrea and vertigo and derealization/confusion and brainfog and was shivering with chills but after I went back to sleep it went away within 1-day and in between time I went on holiday and suffered vertigo and ear pain on the car ride down and the initial sickness did not appear until Feb 9th I got the bad flu w/sore throat, vertigo, ear pain, coughing, running nose, chills, diahorrea etc. And on Feb 13th I then suffered derealization, severe brainfog, crying and sadness and anxiety, REM sleep issues like: falling sensation that jolts awake, flashing behind eyelids, hypnogogic hallucination, constant vivid nightmares every night, head pressure, diahorrea, excessive urination and short-term memory loss and a bunch of other stuff then around early March came a psychotic ocd presentation where I had this delusion I was developing shitzophrenia and had an intense fear of it and constantly Googled it then that sort of stopped and the derealization died down a bit and I was left with andeonia complete loss of emotions and then severe depression and mood swings the came these mini-stroke/seizures and severe brainfog that happened around start of last month and every time I had them I was getting memory-loss after long term and short-term almost dementia like memory loss then I developed an internal vibration. So currently of now my symptoms are: a slight brainfog, internal vibration, dementia memory-loss, vivid nightmares: still having hypnogogic hallucination upon waking, minor head pressure, crying and sadness/severe depression, and complete loss of emotional enjoyment in life, loss of track of time and what is going on around me, inability to retain information, loss of imagination, hair thinning, easily bruising, loss of libido, abdomen pain. So as of now I am 5.5 months into this illness and shts only getting worse I have had many blood tests, tried different diets, meds help with mood but none of the other symptoms, tried therapy, had 2 CT scans of head w/o Contrast tried heaps nothing works. I personally think it is maybe autoimmune encephalitis due to a virus, covid maybe? Not sure. So yeah I am pre much F'ed atm. Me and my girlfriend do long distance and she has stuck by me all through this, she flys up to where I live today as her family lives here and she comes up every school holidays I love her so much and she says she loves and supports me and will do till death and we are keeping each other alive as she struggles with her own issues too but I just feel useless and dead. An example is my nana she is in a dementia home and you look into her eyes and the life is just gone... No soul, just a lost mind trapped within a body that imprisons her that is how I feel atm and I do not want this to go on forever as I cannot feel life and emotions and feel severaly disconnected from everything and have impaired cognitive function as well as experiencing symptoms on the daily. I have always had a different insight on life I feel and have always thought and felt different from others idk why but I just have I feel special in this world and sometimes I wonder if it is just me alive and everyone else is figure of imagination idek haha. My plan is too spend my last 2-weeks with her and then if I feel no better or see no reason to continue then I will end it. Sorry for all the words and wall of text you prolly do not need my life story but I want to make sure my story is read by atleast someone before I go.As many of you know its a dog eat dog world and weakness is not tolerated and only the strongest survive unfortunately I am no longer strong and just a she will of a man really so yeah I was crying afraid of death and asking why this has happened to me for ages every night alone but I now realise maybe the good go first so we do not experience as much suffering as the bad who live on and generally die alone. The world is a strange place atm and is just full of pain, narcassism, suffering, corruption. I also tried talking to my parents to provide guidance and they just tell me to accept my fate so yeah idek : P thanks for reading this far btw and god bless. 19 year old male my life is over.",Suicidal

46281,"A minor adjustment to my meds. So I’ve been really lucky with meds and lifestyle changes being really successful for me. I have bipolar 2 and anxiety, I’ve been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried, and it’s always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. I’m productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. We’re trying Celexa right now. 

So I took it last night (she said some people prefer night, some morning) for the first time and couldn’t sleep very well. So I’m definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. 

I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. I’m still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. 

BUT, I don’t know if it’s too soon to tell, obviously it’s been like 12 hours, but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect (although I’m usually skeptical that things will work) or maybe I’m just super lucky with things working on the first try. 

I don’t know. Just letting y’all know that I’m feeling optimistic and happy. I felt pretty good before, but let my doctor know even though I was stable, I was still struggling a little with depression and I’m hopefully this addition works out. ",Bipolar

14507,"Well, ever since I was a toddler, my parents never got along well. The hardest part was when I had to choose sides. Currently I live with my little brother and mother. When I was younger, I chose sides with my father since he was a little less strict. Because of that my mother holds a lot of hatred against me. She insulted me since I was 5 when my father was not around. And in the past 2 years ever since Covid started, She started taking Work From Home. My mother and I never got along well, mostly because I am a tomboy and my she bought a lot of tricks and girly dresses and a very few t-shirts. So, I tend to only wear the t-shirts, but my neighbour's kid who is a girl loves girly stuff, so most of the time my mother wishes I was not her daughter. And also as I earlier stated that she hated me and the reason for that. As my mother started insulting me about that I am dumb since I am a girl etc. I went kind of crazy. Until one day I could not take it anymore and screamed. I know that was bad of me but I could not control myself this time. And to top things off, my brother behaves like a literal baby, even though he is not one. Which usually gets me into trouble. And fun fact, if my brother does the same mistake as me, my mother is more kind to him compared to me. And I currently have a bad relationship with my father and I do not have anyone who I can go to. And I think my mother has a weird obsession if making me look bad in front of people by telling them my day to day mistakes. But no one's perfect. My mental state has gone to the thought of me killing myself, I have tried to but my dreams get in the way. I like singing so when I mentioned earlier that I screamed, it was pretty loud since my voice went high because I have been practicing a few songs. Now a days, I do not like interacting with many people, I only opened up to 2 people in this lifetime and neither of my parents are included in the list of those 2 people.

46923,"Questions for you people, who are bipolar. Hey, I'm actually not bipolar, but my ex-girlfriend is and I had some questions regarding the disorder. I hope that this is allowed on this subreddit, if it isn't then I'm sorry.

We dated for 2 years. Before we got together she was in a manic episode and then afterwards we got together. At this point I didn't even know that she was bipolar. She had social anxiety, schizophrenia and depressions, the same as me, so we worked perfectly together. We would sit at home, playing videogames and were just enjoying the company of the other person. 

Then her life changed. She finally found the motivation to get into a new class and I think this is what triggered the manic episode. She was suddenly a complete other person, she spent like 1000$ (all she had) on creative things and new hobbies. She was really outgoing, which I wasn't used to at all. And then it happened. She met with another guy. Then she met a second time with him. Until then I just thought she is finally making friends, but then she cancelled a date with me to go out partying with the guy and another friend of hers. That was the moment I realised something was seriously wrong. We had a talk. She didn't cheat, but she also made it pretty clear that she does not want the relationship anymore. I asked her why and she couldn't even give me an answer. She tried to explain it by ""feeling like she is trapped in a cage."" and I first thought that she meant she wants sex with other guys, but no. She told me she misses the time from before the relationship (her last manic episode). And yes I know that it sounds like she cheated, but she didn't, I know this for a fact.

Even more things happened. She proposed the idea of a 1 month relationship break (without cheating). I agreed. And I think that was the time where the manic episode manifested itself completely.

After 1 month I texted her and her response clearly showed me that there is no spark of common sense left in her. She didn't care about anything anymore. She straight up told me that she knew 3 weeks ago already that it won't work. She told me she is currently at a restaurant with another guy and she will bring him with her later to pick up her stuff. When she arrived she had completely new clothes, a new haircut, tons of make-up.

BUT I also knew that she did not do any of this to hurt me. It was pretty obvious that she didn't really have a clue what her actions did anymore. It was almost like a child that just wants to have fun and that doesn't even realise how his actions affect other people.

1 week later I visited her parents to get back my stuff and they just cried and told me they don't know what's wrong with her and that she is behaving really weirdly lately.

So now my questions for you guys : What will happen once her manic episode is over ? Will she feel regret and shame ? And what can I do to prevent that ? She tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past and I'm almost sure that once she realises what she has done, that she will do it again. And the last times I was there for her, but I'm scared that she is too ashamed to contact me this time. After the break up I texted her that she can contact me anytime, but I'm not sure if she will do it. I mean, what happens to you guys once the manic episode is over ? And especially what happens when the manic episode started like this ?",Bipolar

11900,"Hello guys, I am here to make a rant about my work culture and having confusion for my future.I work as a account cum admin clerk at a hardware shop. A 8-5 job on Monday to Friday and Saturday from 8-3. My work used to be just doing paperwork and giving assistance to my supervisors. Making receipts to customers,making payment to supplier, filing documents and so on. On the last few weeks my job workload increased a lot, my supervisor and boss keep calling us to do counter sales job because they are being too busy making delivery orders and invoice,or should I say my boss is does not want to hire new people even though we are understaffed.At first I am fine, but when it goes on and on I realized I had no time for own work and started feeling burnout every day.Every morning when I woke up, I literally had anxiety going for my job. I keep stressing out about things they are going to go wrong in my work environment and having fear going to work simply because I am just too tired waking up every morning stressing out over the same thing over and over again in order to satisfy this company's lust and needs.My boss also keep adding work to me which includes calling me to learn POS system because he wanted the counter sales more self-sufficient and making sure the money in drawer is tally with our system. But I know nothing about the system, I try to ask my colleagues about the POS system and no one wanted to help me with it, they are all selfish people who just want to complete their own job without being bother by other people. I do not know is this the chinese culture or not but every senior in my office seems to be lazy and do not want to care a bunch about others people work even though they are supervisor of their position. This is not included in my job descriptions when I first entered the company and makes me felt puzzled it too.My boss also wanted me to create a KPI system for the company in order to maintain good work ethics and making sure everybody voice got heard. But from what I know and see that, this company workers have frequent complain over the years but my boss just would not care a thing, so I exactly do not know what this kpi system is for and I had no time for doing it also.I had think about quitting the job more than a few times already but I am afraid I cannot find another job because of it.I am just a 20 years old male where I had no chance going to college Because my family is not rich and they also having a concept of ""only work will makes you Rich instead of study""My mum being a little bit considerate saying that even though you want to go to college who going to pay for your college fees?I am kind of puzzled now for my future, I saw all my friends having a plan and a target in their life.

I have severe ptsd affiliated with cannabis ( using that term because any other will just mess me up again ) and since I have people that will wonder why, and why I have a hatred to it.. a couple years ago my sister had just started and was using a vape that had cbd or thc in it. Her and her bf were taking turns using it and me being stupid I asked to take a hit from it, the feeling it gave me was strange, i coughed a lot and made me woozy. I made the mistake of asking for another, I only got for like a second and I erupted into coughing my ass off, I coughed all the air in my lungs out multiple times, felt like I was going to die either to my lungs collapsing or suffocating, I managed to catch my breath after coughing it all out at least 3 times.. by then, I had already been traumatized from fighting for my life for a good 5 minutes.. I felt lightheaded, my heart was racing and I was breathing extremely fast. I do not remember the high at all because of what happened. Ever since that day I have gotten slightly better in, talking about it does not hurt anymore, but triggers include smell and watching as someone does it. I did not watch my sister do it today, but the smell, soon as it hit me I rushed outside, holding my breath until then. Went to my car and silently felt everything again, I just on a strong face for my sister when she asked me if I was okay. She went inside after a few minutes. And I just silently started crying because I remember everything about that day, fighting, fear, everything.. kept in mind I am really good at holding myself back, acting stronger than I actually am.

I feel like I am missing pieces, I do not know how to describe it properly.

And not all at once, but gradually over time. Like one day I might wake up and look down to see my leg is gone or my hand is missing fingers. It makes me feel sick. Its like body horror but only I can see it or feel it. I will never be the same again and the further I go on the more mutilated it get. It feels like something puts me on a surgical table and injects me with a sedative so I cannot move, but I can still see and still feel it and then it straps me down and takes pieces of me and then throws me back out into the world to figure out how to come to terms with my new disfigurements. Its horrific but I am too numb and tired to scream or react. Its like a waking nightmare and no one can see it but me.I cannot explain it properly. But I am trapped in this feeling and I am silently horrified. But I am also tired. I just want to lay down and rest but the parts of me that allowed me to rest are gone now too, like having my eyelids removed.

I’ve been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection, but lately I’ve been noticing some other things (which I won’t mention so you don’t fall down the same hole Im in) and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea: Googling my symptoms. I came across something rare, sporadic, and deadly (of course) and I’m now constantly worried that it’s something that could be far more serious. Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom, I didn’t mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding. He felt the area and chalked it up to side effects of the sinus infection, but of course since he didn’t SPECIFICALLY say “it’s not ____” and the symptoms have come back, i’m now back to spiraling between “you’re just making it worse” and “maybe I should make sure just to be safe.”  Any advice to get my mind off of the possibility when I still feel like I’m feeling the symptoms? 

I have this huge urge to go back to a doctor and get specific reassurance, but I know that’s problematic in the long run and could end up getting expensive for no real reason. Not to mention I’d feel a bit ridiculous.  Really starting to think I should see a psych, as I haven’t since my anxiety began as a more generalized disorder a little over a year ago :/",Anxiety
45989,"Have been taking Lexapro 10mg for past 4 days. Feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. Not sure if it's Lexapro or if it might be a hypomanic or a manic phase.(X-post from r/depression) I'm not sure if cross-posting is allowed. Here is the [link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/87a00b/have_been_taking_lexapro_10mg_for_past_4_days/) on r/depression. 

**TL;DR** Not sure what type of depressive disorder(PDD, Smiling Depression, SAD, Cyclothymia or Bipolar 2) I have. My psychiatrist started me Lexapro 10mg and based on how it goes, he said we could try switching to mood support meds. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. I'm worried I might be in a hypomanic or a manic phase(got told by my psychiatrist that Lexapro elevates the mania and asked me not to take it if I'm in a hypomanic or manic phase).


I met my psychiatrist last Thursday and we talked about my depression. I've always had ups and downs in my life for a few years. But I always thought it was because of my actions that caused then and not the other way around. I'm still not sure what type of depressive disorder I have. Since I had like 2 weeks time before my appointment, I did a bit of research reading about the depression types and how each of them is different in their own way. So I told my psychiatrist that I wasn't sure if had the persistent depressive disorder, seasonal affective depression, smiling depression or Cyclothymia(aka bipolar lite).


When I was doing my research and if there was something relatable to me or if something similar has happened to me before, I noted them down as a list. We talked about how I identified that I was depressed and all the points on the list. Then he told me that even he wasn't sure if I had Dysthymia, smiling depression, bipolar 2, or cyclothymia. So as a general procedure, he said that he is going to prescribe me meds to help with depression and if it doesn't work, he is going to prescribe me mood support meds for cyclothymia or bipolar 2. 


He prescribed Lexapro 10mg to take every morning and asked me to get back to him in 2 weeks about how the meds were working. He also warned me not to take Lexapro if I feel like I have a hypomanic or a manic phase as it might elevate the mania. 


I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like I'm not depressed since yesterday. I was not sure if it's my hypomanic phase and I didn't take my meds today.


So these were the differences that I noticed in me yesterday compared to the day before:


* I feel fresh, more energetic, and I feel like I got back my motivation to do things. 
* I've been procrastinating to buy my vitamins for a week and I ordered them yesterday (I still have vitamins for the next couple of days) 
* I smoked close to double the number of cigarettes than I did during the past few days
* I was clenching my jaw more than usual and today morning, I had a little pain in my enamel 
* I've been hitting my bed at 12ish and could sleep only by around 4 or 5 in the morning and I slept for around 4 hours for the past couple of weeks. I started using melatonin for last week and it helped me get to sleep by 12. I used to sleep for 10 to 11 hours on melatonin. But last night, I didn't take melatonin. I went to bed at 12 and slept in a few mins, and woke up at approx 8. 
* I planned my family's trip to the US (have been wanting to do this for weeks) 
* I could never stay interested in a single topic for more than 10 mins max. I watched the entire Dota 2 loregasm playlist by SirActionSlacks. It has 12 videos and it took around 3.5 hours to finish. I watched the whole thing without any break. 
* I completed the tax return process on Sprintax. I still have to take a printout and mail it, but I got my w2 and access to Sprintax like more than a month ago and I've been procrastinating to finish it. 
* Finally, I usually don't write this long posts if I'm not on Adderall (diagnosed with ADHD), but I'm not on Adderall now.

I have an internship doing stuff I legit dreamed about as a child, making more money in a season than some people do all year, living in California, with a social life and a roof over my head. I have a full ride for a masters degree and am a published scientific author and have done thing that five years ago I could have only dreamed of doing. But I am not happy.In January my best friend of 10 years, who I had recently, killed themselves. They were the first person I talked to every day and tbh some days they were also the only person I talked to. They were beautiful and kind and the nicest person I have ever met and I would have given them the world without hesitation. I loved them (in every sense) more than I have ever loved anyone else including myself. We actually ran away together but then had to come back because of our silly little obligations. Even before they passed I had days were the only reason I got out of bed and went to class was because I knew it would distract me from the things that were keeping me in bed. I would frequently lay on the floor for hours at the end of the day, so much so that I eventually just go a sleeping bag which I keep rolled out in a corner of my room. My poor mental health only spiraled after their death. Suddenly, the person I told everything to was gone. The person who forced me to apply to half of those things was gone. And so when acceptance letters were rolling in I was not happy because I could not celebrate with the one person I wanted to celebrate with. I am not saying they were my only friend, I have 3 other people that I al extremely close to, but my friend who passed was always the very first person I told.Then in late April things got really bad and I ended up getting forcibly hospitalized for a week. Suddenly all of the freedom that I spent my entire life working for was gone and I had to work my ass of to be cleared for release.Now I just feel weird all the time.

I’ve been depressed and horrible anxious since I can remember and it’s gotten in the way of everything and everyone my entire life… i guess my question here is what should I start doing with my life? I feel as though I want a fresh start. I’ve been sitting here for the past week and I can’t for the life of me figure out what to do. All I know is I can not work another customer service job, I hate them so much. Please give suggestions on job paths for people like me. Thank you!!!",Depression
52164,"I’ve been having panic attacks that resulted in extreme adrenaline rushes daily for the past few weeks. I am a 24yo male, i have suffered with gad and panic attacks ever since i was 16. 

Over the years i went to therapy and even overcame (mostly at least) my health anxiety. 
To a point that both my psychiatrist (psychotherapist? Imho not sure, English isn’t my first language) and I felt as if could go back to going to a psychologist. Everything has been going okay, i kept eating well, i exercise regularly (4/5 times x week at the gym, walks with my dog, and i try to walk around as much as i can other than my commute to work, not 10k steps on most days, but i try to stay active) 

I have been on medications. I used xanax regularly and then started using it only if needed. Once these panic attacks began, i decided to switch to diazepam, since the xanax was making me very sleepy without helping too much with the anxiety. That didn’t help. 

I started having panic attacks/adrenaline rushes for every minor incident or event. 5 mins late for a meetup/reservation? High heart rate, anxiety all the usual. Calling a client on the phone and telling them they’ll have to pay xx amount? Same result. Everything minor sends me towards a panic attack/adrenaline rush. Even weed, which i smoked probably once per week on a friday evening started giving me horrible panic attacks, even if wasn’t still high yet. 

I’m really at a loss here, i don’t want to go on like this and I’m kind of worried for my health and the impact this anxiety has on it. I will bring this up during my next session, but in the meantime i wanted to confront myself with someone that has/is experiencing the same issues.

Thank you all",Anxiety

I posted it, and I waited.I waited 5 minutes, then 15 minutes, then 30 minutes. Before I knew it, I would been staring at the screen for over two hours, waiting, praying for someone to say something.After two hours I got a response, and all it did was make everything so much worse. It solidified my view of myself, being unable to do right despite my every attempt, my countless efforts done in all manner of ways.Two hours of waiting, and all I got was someone telling me that I was banned for a reason, implying that my effort, despite it being done in the nicest way I could muster, was in vain.If you were to tell me 1 month ago that attempting to be kind would because me to, in a way, spiral down a rabbit hole of self-pity and self-loathing I would have called you a pessimist. I would have attempted to justify it with optimism and passion that is rarely seen these days.But now? Now I would call you a speaker of nothing but the truth, in that regard.it is the sad reality that I have now come to realize encompasses my whole being. The sad reality that I am a broken light in the dark tunnel that is everyday life. A light still sputtering but quickly losing its function. I am not sure where else to post this really, take it down if you all must but I feel it can be good to read for those feeling down.

7746,I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop.

I am so tired i do not know how long I can go without completely giving up laying in my bed until I am evicted then laying on the street till i die. that is how my depression and anxiety make me feel.

35691,"Concussion anxiety taking over my life Let me just preface this by saying I've been essentially the hugest hypochondriac my entire life, even to the point of freaking out over a bat *maybe* biting me after it flew over my head once. I've never been this anxious about anything because getting a life threatening TBI is my hugest fear and it's basically consumed me.

Almost two full days ago, I slammed my head four times within two or so hours against a few different walls. Not ruthlessly hard, but *just* hard enough to worry. I matched basically no concussion symptoms at the time but it hasn't stopped me from flipping out excessively. Since I woke up yesterday though, I've gotten minor potential symptoms that made it so I couldn't function in my normal life without freaking out, which has worried me. While I didn't get a headache, I had minor, non-painful, yet strange feeling head pressure, (especially when moving it,) slight sensitivity to light, occasionally feeling dazed, me not being able to remember or place words in sentences, etc. It became rough trying to figure out which 'symptoms' were from me freaking myself out, and which could be potentially real. I even stopped drinking coffee because I'm so freaked out caffeine could make my 'concussion' worse.

The worst part came last night, when I dozed off while hanging out with friends watching a movie around 8. *I couldn't sleep.* I kept jerking myself awake and my body refused to do anything, heart racing, and it got to the point I kept taking 20 hour power naps until midnight where I'd wake up in a total daze with some of the worst anxiety I've had in my life. So, reasonably, I Googled symptoms to subdermal hematomas, which freaked me out even *more,* because now I'm convinced I have a brain bleed. I woke up this morning and I still feel dazed, still shaking, even though the only remaining concussion symptom is me feeling pretty dumb and detached from the world. Even *after* friends who've had real concussions reassured me, nothing's helped, in fact me Googling shit made it worse (like always.) 

I guess my rant results to me asking whether or not I'm justified being like this. I've been honest to God debating on just driving to an ER or something immediately despite potential freakout and the fact I'm only 18 because almost nothing else has entered my mind. The anxiety has been consuming me, and I'm 100% convinced I'm dying, and it's the *worst.*",Anxiety

50664,"Expressing myself I feel like I’ve had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. It’s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort.

 I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the ‘fake it til you make it strategy’. Although I became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But I’m trying something different.

It’s very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way (for better or worse). Also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.

As I said it’s challenging and not always doable, this is because 
1. A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.
2. My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.
3. The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.

But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what’s on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said, but whether or not that is true isn’t important.

I’ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.

Anyway, I’m tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame, but at least I won’t have to strain myself into a ‘safe’ caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.",Personality disorder

I was planning on downing sleeping pills and drinking a bottle of whiskey, but when I took a shot and was ready to take the pills the shot made me throw up. I have never puked like that so I took it as that I need to stop before this becomes a habbit.

I was not drinking for fun I was doing it to suppress shit and not feel.I was drunk mostly from April through May and in June a little too but that is when I slowed down mostly. Now it feels like a need just to do it, I just wan to be drunk right now. Fuck this sucks even thinking about it makes me want to say fuck it and get drunk. it is all mental too like physically idk if I want that but mentally I want it if that makes sense.

""Friends"" I guess I do not even know what that means, but I do know now that I do not matter. I used to think it was disrespectful for people to wait until you are dead to finally show up and act like you were some valuable part of their life. Everyone dresses nice. They talk about how great you were. there is comforting and crying, rather they really liked you or not. But to actually get to see that no one would even come to your funeral, that hurts. That really hurts. I woke up the next day still alive and no one cared. And the day after that, still alone. Too embarrassed to reach out for help. The days passed and the people that were most important to me had not reached out to me either. I was essentially dead. I stopped going to work. I cannot face anyone that might know what I tried to do. Again. Over six months have passed. My girlfriend either does not know what happened or has pretended not to. I cannot talk to her about it. She does not understand any kind of depression. She thinks you just turn it off and decide to be happy. Well she is happier now anyway. She never likes my friends. She does not want me to have anyone else. it is been very noticable these past months how much happier she is since I have not spoken to anyone.So I fake it. I pretend I am fine. We cook the meals. We say the ""I love you""s. We do the road trips. The weeks go on and I am alone. I hide the pain. I suppress the anger. I distract my self with little projects that I do not even care about. And I drink a lot. It dulls the constant anxiety. I have to drink when we go hang out with her friends to bury the hatred I feel that she gets to enjoy the company of the people she chooses. So I keep drinking and pretend I do not want to scream. I pretend that I am not jealous of every other person I see. I drink even more to forget how embarrassed I am just being me so I can try to act like I belong there when I know I do not. I do not belong here. I am just waiting. Always hoping something else will accomplish the task that I have been incapable of. Just waiting to die. And it is not even so much that I want to die as it is that I sure as hell do not want to go on living. So I just keep waiting, lying to everyone and pretending I am fine. there is no purpose in posting this. I just needed to put it out there. I need to vent.",Suicidal

52948,"College Student w/ Anxiety: Dating Life I first developed severe anxiety and panic disorder in my senior year of high school. I can proudly say that with perseverance, proper medication, and the help of my lovely therapist, family, and friends, I was able to complete my senior year and begin college in the fall. I’ve taken a liking to this guy in my class, and we will hang out this weekend. I am very inexperienced in the dating world as I’ve only really gone out with three guys ever… none of which lasted more than a few months. Though I had not been diagnosed with anxiety in my sophomore year of high school, I began dating this guy whom I was pretty infatuated with. However, the first time he put his arm around me, I shook uncontrollably. I misread that as a sign that he wasn’t suitable for me when it was just anxiety. Fast forward to now, I am anxious about seeing this guy this weekend, and I am scared that these feelings of fear won’t go away even if we continue to see each other. Has anyone else been through this? What should I do? I don’t want to be limited from dating but l my body is giving me unclear signals of what to do.",Anxiety

At first she thought I had done it on accident, as I was in the kitchen, and seemed very concerned. However, when I told her I had done it on purpose, she instantly become very upset. It did not seem to be in a concerned way, more of an angry, upset way, like it was inconvenient for her. My wounds were not horrible or bad to the point of hospitalization, but they were concerning, and some were deep. My mom told me to put some neosporin on them and go back to sleep. I told her I did not feel safe and asked her if we should call someone, take me somewhere. She told me I was not bleeding out so no one could do anything for me. She told me I was fine and that I was doing this for attention. At first I thought she was crazy, but now I am scared that she is right. I was not able to go through with it so maybe I am subconsciously doing it for attention. She had texted my cousin the next day to check up on me because I was ""doing weird stuff"". It made me so sad because my mother continues to act like everything is normal. She has not to talk about it since, but when I bring it up she gets very mad, and always says ""I do not care. Grow up. Move out"". She always tells me how sensitive I am and how I am just emotional for no reason, or because I am seeking attention. I had moved away to college in September, and my parents had insisted I come back in October because of covid. During arguments, they always bring it up, telling me I should have stayed up there, and that they just want me to leave. I am so close to moving away for my next year of college, but it seems like the closer I get to leaving, the worse my thoughts become. I am just so scared of what might happen to me. I want a relationship with my mom so bad because I really do love her, but it seems like she does not want one. She treats me so much worse than my younger sibling and it hurts me so bad. It truly feels like they would not care. I just want to be able to do it. I know that I need help but it is so difficult when there is so form of support in my regular life. I hate venting to friends because it is such a serious topic, I do not want to scare them or burden them, making them wonder if I am okay ya know?I feel so sad all the time and I am just counting down the days until I can try again or leave, whichever comes first.

I would say I am not really feeling anything at the moment, but that would be a partial lie. On the inside, I have no emotional reaction that I can feel (which I usually can). But, a song that means a lot to me just came on, and I started to cry. Its called Might you, and its in my Spotify likes, aguyss well as my Anime playlist. Can you play this song at my funeral? Its from My Hero Academia, so not many people there (if anyone shows up) will understand the context, but its a good song even without knowing the series. Its 11:09 pm right now. I do not know how long this note will take me. I guess I should say sorry to everyone, but there are surprisingly few people that I talk to. Really, its only my family and people at work. that is kind of sad. Mom and dad, I am sorry that I could not be the daughter you dreamed I was going to be. Frankly, I am not your daughter at all, since I am (was?) non-binary (neither a man nor a woman). Please do not refer to me as your daughter at my funeral. I do not care if that will confuse any relatives. I love you guys. ******, I am sorry I was such a jerk. I am really sorry that I would pick on you, and fight with you, and overall annoy you every single day. To make up for it, you can have all of my stuffed animals, as well as all of my snowglobes. I love you. ******, I am sorry I did not work harder to be closer to you. I am sorry I was a little asshole when we were growing up (which is why you hated me probably up until you went to Italy for that period of time). You were a great older sibling, and I wanted to be just like you for a long time. you are the reason I got into art, even though I have not really drawn anything in forever. do not be afraid to be yourself, even when it seems like everything will go wrong if you do. I love you. *****, you cannot read this. I do not even know if you can read honestly, and you probably will not understand what is going on at all. Autism sucks, huh? I would not really know, because I do not have it. Anyways, you can have my lightsabers, and my Spiderman pop-out painting thing. And my iPad, if you want. But you have to share it with ******. I love you. All my coworkers, I am sorry if I made everything about myself. I am also sorry if I made any of you uncomfortable, or if I overshared a lot. I did not really know how to cope with things (obviously, since I am dead now), and talking about it helped me process things in a way. You are all really nice (well, most of you. Some of you really frustrated me), and I hope you go on to find good jobs and live good lives. I considered a few of you really good friends, though I doubt you thought the same of me. Cinnamon, Laura, and Ella, I am even making a paragraph for you, even though you are animals and cannot read. I loved all three of you very much, and I loved spending time with you. This much is obvious, but Cinnamon was my favorite. That does not mean I loved the other two any less. I hope you three receive plenty of love now that I am gone, as well as belly rubs and scratches in your favorite places. I do not know what else to write. I was a really selfish person. Honestly, I was also kind of an asshole. I do not know why, its hard to explain, but I just was. I know my parents will be angry when I say this, but life was not great for me. Yeah, I lived in a good home (though it was really passive aggressive a lot of the time, and I never felt like my emotions and opinions were respected), but life is not good when you cannot feel much, and when you do feel it is not good. I just cannot keep living life where I am suffering in silence (was I silent about it though? I do not know. I am not that self-aware). My emotions did not really work right, I have nearly acted on a LOT of intrusive thoughts, and I often made things about myself when they had nothing to do with me. I guess that came from me feeling left out of things when I lived in Oregon. Speaking of Oregon, MAN that place sucked. Seriously, do not ever go there, whoever is reading this. My opinion may be biased, as I was sexually and mentally/emotionally abused from the beginning of 7th grade to halfway through 9th grade by this group of people who I considered to be friends, even though they never were. 0/10, do not recommend it to anyone. Can you make my funeral (if you hold one) open casket? Also, I want to wear a suit. I cannot really do anything if you put me in a dress, but still do not put me in one. Also, can you have non-binary flag and pansexual flag colors in some places? Maybe put a couple pins on my suit? That would be cool. Also, you can really have any food you want. Its not like Ill be eating it (Is it okay to joke about that? Its dark humor, and idk how many people will appreciate that). Anyone is allowed to come, but make sure to invite my coworkers. Oh, and do not hire a priest. I know you did not want to admit this, but I do not believe in God. Sorry if you think that hurts my soul, and that Ill go to hell, but I do not believe in that. Who are we to say what is real and what is not, when we cannot see it? Oh, and I want ***** ****** to have all my manga. You can donate the rest of my books (unless someone I know wants one), as well as my clothes. ***** can have my anime figures as well. If you want to keep it that long, ****** can have Sheldon (my car). I do not have much of it, but can you donate the money that I do have to The Trevor Project (a charity to help mentally ill LGBTQ teens). It is now 11:33 pm.

I've tried everything I can think of, from therapy, CBT and going to my doctor to exercise, dieting, lifestyle changes, meditation, supplements and so on. I can't access meds. I don't have any offline support network.

The past year was the year with the least depression for me. I didn't really want to die anymore but I wouldn't have minded either way. I tried all of the above things. I still doubt I can ever hold down a job, have a relationship or study. I'm pretty close to being kicked out of school again. 

This past week the day I spent the most time not crying or laying in bed was new years eve. I think 2 hours for a movie and 2 hours for a meal with family. I could bear to listen to music today and didn't throw up my lunch so that's an improvement.

I've been mostly lurking around here for many months now, and I'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like I don't belong, or I'm an odd one out. Like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own, or have an understanding of what AvPD means that clashes with my own, or they have (fairly ordinary) life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me.

I don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself (if AvPD is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness), and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path I've taken through life.

Also, Reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind', where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. I see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance, but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?

If you don't feel you fit in, why is that, specifically? What details about you clash with what you perceive as the Reddit or r/AvPD culture(s)?

And if you DO feel you fit in, especially on Reddit in general, how does that relate to your AvPD? Is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective, something like that?

We are highly focused and streamlined, yet loose and flexible (effortless effort being the motto). Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can propel us to 5th dimension and beyond while still connected to Earth but ultimately undergoing physical transfiguration, also fueled by the bowels of the earth likewise (as above so below)- which constructs a beastly cyclotron that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.

&amp;#x200B;

""As soon as humanity unites on this planet, it will qualify to establish contact with other more advanced civilizations, such as the Agarthans and those from the GF. In fact the Agarthans and some ascended masters such as St. Germain will already help us run the cities of light and the numerous healing centres which will manifest very soon all over the globe. The next step will be visiting other civilizations, but this could only happen after the incarnated human personality has completed the LBP and has ascended at least to 5D by transfiguring from a carbon-based body into crystalline light body.""

The three cities of light will be open portals to the multiverse and to numerous advanced humanoid, and later on, other civilisations, such as the dragons. Alone this fact will make the existence of national states and nations obsolete as all the people will recognize their multidimensional nature and will strive to ascend too and be able to live in these cities of light and enjoy the advantages of a higher dimensional life. In the first place, they will enjoy the healing possibilities there which will help all humans advance rapidly in their LBP and also ascend.

""You see, nothing is ever just about one thing. We are not just sharing information with you. We are also preparing you for contact. Now, all of the other beings from the other star systems that are connecting with you all through the various channels that you have there on Earth are doing the same thing. And certainly those who channel faeries are readying you for more interactions with the fae.""

""We are excited to witness the coming together of humanity and the Arcturian beings that you will be meeting in the flesh. Now, of course, some have already established connections with physical Arcturian beings.  A full and open contact with the fourth and fifth dimensional beings who are from our little star system.""

I used to talk constantly, I always had something to say. I was also a bit of a wild card so people often found me entertaining.

But now I don’t talk so much and I no longer feel full of energy. There will be times when I hang out with friends and there are long awkward silences.

I went on a couple dates with a guy a couple weeks ago and he kept telling me that I seemed really tired. I wasn’t. Apparently I’m boring now.

48275,"Can someone relate or am I broken? I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore, and it's a vicious cycle. And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me.

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.

If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.",Depression

34555,"Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site: https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php

But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really, finally worked. I have major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and C-PTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much, I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process (TRTP). it is 3 sessions. Session 1: stop self sabotageSession 2: address and leave behind the traumaSession 3: set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR, CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP - Holy shit.",Depression

46694,"My doctor put me on a leave. I've been stable for a long time without meds. It's been about 11 years. 

Well that changed. 

Last week I started having some derealization, depersonalization and sensory sensitivity. The mental illness was hard to hide. 

I run myself hard. 1.5 jobs with complex advocacy/legal-y components. For the last five years, I went to school part time while I worked one or two jobs full time. I over commit myself constantly. And that is through hypo-mania and depression. I push. I always push myself. And I may have just run myself down.  

So now I'm off work with an unknown return date and waiting for her to call in drugs for me. Lithium is on the top of the list. I've never been on it before, and I've heard good and bad things. 

It just sort of is what it is. I'm trying to treat this like a vacation for now. I do what I want, when I want. I almost feel like I have a free pass to eat all the cookies because I'm crazy (in a comedic, not dangerous to self and others kind of sense).

This is very surreal for me. I have been in this same general zone before when I was a teenager, but I was in the US then and they still made me go to school and perform. I still needed to maintain my GPA (which didn't happen). So it's strange that this is taken so seriously now. I'm pleased about it, but it it's still hard to conceptualize. 

And that's it... Thank you for reading.

Just cannot work up the courage to do it and cannot get past the guilt of loved ones Ill leave behind. I have answered both assessments honestly about my suicidal thoughts and plans.So after group today, I get a call from them saying the doctor wanted to speak with me. He asks me about my suicidal ideation and wants to know if I think I am a m going to hurt myself or others. I told him I definitely will not hurt anyone else. He replies that if I do not tell him no for both he will send the police to my house and have me baker acted. He was very aggressive about it. I have been inpatient before and do not like the feeling of being locked up. So I told him no I will not hurt myself or others.So now I am thinking I should just lie on the assessment from now on because I do not want to have to go thru this every day with being questioned for I fill the form out honestly. I mean I am sure its just so they would not be liable if I did hurt myself and they did not take action after learning I was having thoughts.But if I lie on the assessment, how is that helping me get thru the suicidal thoughts.

16449,"28 male here. This is something I never felt comfortable about talking to anyone about it in person as I do get emotional about it too much. I have had suicidal thoughts over the years, never brought myself to go through with it but they still linger in the back of my mind. First time was when I was in year 10 at school. All through my young life I was bullied physically and verbally. By that point I just felt completely shit about myself, felt that I had no friends, did not deserve any friends and did not deserve to live anymore. Ended up writing a letter stating how I was feeling and passed it onto one of the guys in my class. Later on that day I was on the top floor of the school walking towards the balcony area under the skylight. My intention was to climb over the barrier, jump from what would have been in effect 6 stories up and aim for the metal plate on the bottom floor.I never got there as my English Teacher called me into her classroom for a chat. Turned out she had been informed about the letter I wrote and she gave me one big pep talk which helped me to feel a bit better about myself and snap back to reality. She never knew that she had just stopped me from jumping.A few years later after I turned 19, I went into the Army. Started developing problems with my knees during basic but managed to complete it. Got to trade training and was really struggling due to my knee problems along with other things. Eventually it got to the point when each time I walked into the accomodation block and looked up to the top floor balcony, I just kept imagining myself hanging from the balcony with paracord around my neck.The knee problems continued and after a few months, I was told that I was going to be recommended for a medical discharge by the doctor. I was completely devastated by this as it was the first job I ever had and I was now going to lose it. I broke down in the medical centre and had to get picked up by one of the training staff from the camp who did provide some comfort. Later on I smuggled a large bottle of Jack Daniels into my room (no alcohol allowed in the block btw) and my intention was to down the whole thing in an attempt to kill myself that way. Again, never went through with and ended up sharing it with some of the lads when we had a trip to the beach.Left the Army in 2014 and since then, I have had a logistics job, done an apprenticeship in Fabrication and Welding and now employed as a semi-skilled fabricator. So been working on myself a lot other the years. But every so often, I have felt crap about myself and hating myself for my past decisions. And on those occasions, a voice pops into myself telling me ""why carry on? Just grab the length of rope you got in the car, go into the woods round the back of your house and just go hang yourself!"" But, there is another voice, a feminine one telling me ""no do not that. you are still doing alright. Just keep going"" and that one always wins.I have no desire to end myself as I know I have still got plenty of opportunities and time to sort myself out and better myself. But I just keep getting haunted by these dark thoughts on occasions and they bring me to tears every time. But somehow I have been able to just stuck it up, dust myself off and soldier on day by day.

I watch behind my computer screen as people go about their lives, making accomplishments and being social, while I just stay in my room and plot my useless ideas. Mostly I just want it to end. Except I have no way to kill myself and every time I have tried has not worked out? I feel most days that the cosmos is taunting me for something I did wrong, and cannot figure out how to make things better. Pain follows pain. In all, I know that I have no way out except death.Most people think that they know loneliness, but nobody knows it better than me. I have very few friends, most of all people view me as an oddity who they do not want to spend time with. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend and I am basically never going to because I am both autistic and asexual. The solitary life might not be so bad if I did not have this craving for human contact that I have had for years (I am now 22). All I long for is to go out with people but I have no way of meeting them. I was bullied in high school and had to drop out. At university, I could not seem to make any because I was too depressed by various things. Covid did not help. And so I have gotten to a stage where I feel like a complete outsider in society, hating myself and divorced from the norms of everyone else. I have very obscure interests, philosophy and literature, and art and movies. On top of that, I do not have any career both because I find it sustain one and my autism.I am an artist, except what good is that if nobody cares about my art? I have made albums of music that nobody really listened to and I was too depressed to advertise. I have also just finished a novel that nobody is going to read. I thought for the past few years that I could express the unique aspects of how I view the world through art, but I do not think it matters. Nobody is interested in me. I could self-publish my book and then nobody will read it. And so I feel constantly invisible, like a ghost that walks through people embedded in the world. I have been forgotten; I do not belong here; I am just a strange cosmic absurdity.And so what are my options in life, go on every day in perpetual misery and loneliness having had many years of proof that nothing gets better? I have no hope, and I can see myself in 10 years being in the exact same state of misery. I cannot bear the thought of continuing on this road, the endless pain.

13727,"So I was diagnosed with major depression and severe anxiety. My father decided to send me to his hometown where I would be cured. He thought I just needed a company and new environment. Because I have been living alone for almost three years. At first I just had severe anxiety which pandemic caused me. But because of the repeated lockdown, I literally could not go outside, and I felt like I was a prisoner. And eventually I got worse and developed major depression.So fast forward. Now I am at my father's family house. At first it was really hard for me to settle but later I gradually managed to adjust. But then, my aunt started sleeping in my room. I really do not want it. I am not comfortable. I do not like it when there are other people in my room. I want to be alone. I can deal with people outside but inside my room I want it to be just my own space. Although everything my aunt does is just sleep here, she really does not bother me but I feel like my privacy has been invaded. I am not really comfortable. I cannot sleep despite taking sleeping pills. I am hallucinating that there is someone next to me which there is really is because I forgot my aunt also sleeps here as I used to live alone. And now, she changed the set up of my room. That really made me burst into tears. it is frustrating. You know having these disorders, its always hard to find to be comfortable. it is hard to adjust.What really distressing me is that I could not tell them. I cannot tell them this and that depressed me. I cannot tell them I am really not well. That my body is suffering. I cannot tell them I do not like this or that. I do not want them to offend. I do not want them to think I am making an attitude. I do not want them to get angry. But its hard. I am struggling. it is really frustrating. My body starts to act up again. What to do? How to say No?",Depression

I want to tell my therapist and/or mom, but I am nervous because i do not want to get sent to the psych ward. id be okay with the psych ward (in fact, i kind of want to go) but after you get out you have to do PHP (part time hospitalization) and then IOP (intensive outpatient) and I have already done IOP (this winter/spring) and it takes a LOT of time and energy. I am going to college at the end of august. what if i have to stay home for the semester because I am doing PHP/IOP?

21780,"There is already such a large shift in emptiness, meaningless and depression now that we strive further and further from our biological instincts and goals. And it will only get worse with the constant races to create new larger than life technology. No matter how much technology we replace ourselves with there are still going to be repressed unfulfilled biological needs, until we replace our neurons with nanobots, digitally upload our brains and leave humanity as a thing of the past. I do not see how anyone desires it but from what I have seen transhumanists are becoming about as popular as anti-industrialists. Its so surreal to me because everything they describe as a dream sounds like a complete nightmare to me - how they long to leave the violent, dirty, senselessness of humanity behind for a clean, robotically perfect utopia. I genuinely want to kms when i think of living in such a world. All the passions and struggles of humanity gone. Not like it would ever happen, because clearly any utopia is impossible until we cure greed from the human mind. And looking at the world right now, the race for this tech can only result in a dystopia. We will dig ourselves deeper and deeper into mass depression, inescapable surveillance and alienation. I do not understand, we all know how depressed we get surrounded by tech for hours on end, we all know the detachment it causes, but we do jack shit about changing anything. Every time some useless little technology comes out everyone rolls their eyes and then buys it, like with alexa especially. Why? Peer pressure? General lack of resistance? I do not get it. The only way to stop moneyhoarding technocrats is to stop buying shit you do not need, and because the sales to plummet. I know sure as hell when literal mindchips come out everyone will protest at first and then buy it. I fuckn hope not tho. I just wanted to experience humanity and I have barely even had a chance to do it. that is all I have ever wanted. I fucking hate it. The idea that humanity is something dirty and aggressive to be left in the past for godly perfection infuriates me.

Hey! Ok, I ask you to read below and try to put yourself in my situation.

2021-04-13:
Long story short. Had been suffering from a long-lasting cough (5-6 weeks) and sought care. The doctor heard something on the left lung and sent me for an urgent x-ray the same day.  I was terrified and thought I had lung cancer.  I was nervous and scared to death until I got my test results back.  It showed nothing but I recovered a few days later.

2021-09-14:
My wife found a liver spot/mole on my back that looked weird. This after I had complained of itching in that place 1-2 months earlier. Thought it was skin cancer and was nervous and scared to death for several weeks before I received an answer that there was no danger. The mole didn't look ""bad"" so they didn't do anything about it.

2021-10-07:
My wife finds a lump on the right shoulder blade, size approx. 1x1 cm. It can be moved but feels strange somehow.  Immediately becomes completely convinced that this is also a cancerous tumor.  Either the skin cancer has spread or it is a sarcoma (soft tissue cancer that can feel exactly like a fatty lump). Once again, I became very nervous, stressed and scared to death. I sought care and was able to see a reputable doctor who informed me that it was a lipoma. When he was about to take it away, he says he can't find it.  I imagined he saw it and it wasn't a lipoma.  He said something to the other doctor and I didn't really understand where.  He you catch me again and the lump is still there.  Instead, he sends me for an urgent MR X-ray and here I am completely destroyed.  I take him as if he has seen something that makes him not dare to cut me.  I lie at home and shake for several days and have such fear of death that it is completely sick. I end up trying to go into that X-ray tunnel but it doesn't work. Tries 3-4 times but I just lie there and cry because I'm afraid of what the x-ray will show.  Here I am completely convinced that it is cancer of some kind.  I had to cancel everything and today the lump is still there.  The doctor called me 3 weeks later and said he was 100% sure it was a lipoma and that it can stay on my body without doing any harm. So, I still have it and I'm alive.

During this course of ""diseases"" I get hemorrhoids and start having stomach problems.  I still have huge problems with my stomach (heartburn, acid regurgitation, irregular stools, stomach pain, stomach cramps, etc.).

I'm simply wondering if this could be the result of some kind of stress, nervousness, panic disorder, death anxiety over an extended period of time?

Note: I have never before had ""problems"" with my stomach (that I know of) but after the above events it is in total revolt.

Please write a line or two what you think.

Sorry for a long post, but it's important and nice for me to write a little.

Thanks!",Stress

21776,"TW: Sexual abuse, domestic violenceSorry if I suck at describing shit, I have Asperger's on top of everything else. Feelings are hard. But here it is.I have lost everything since I graduated high school. There was a girl I was dating, we broke up. We tried to keep in touch, but things did not work out. She went missing in October. The one person who ever gave a shit about me just fell off the face of the Earth. No one's heard from her since. I know her, she does not just up and leave. Nobody heard anything. So even though I want to stay hopeful, it is been 9 months as of today. I do not even know how to feel about it anymore. If she did not come into my life when she did, I would have done it by now. She swooped in like my guardian angel and she saved my life. But now she is gone. she is been gone, but this is different. I cannot describe how, but it just is.I could trust her, unlike anyone else. My friends have all ditched me in one way or another. My father abandoned me in favor of a bottle and a needle. My mother was always working. My uncle molested me until I was 9. My grandmother has been in and out of the hospital. My grandfather (even though he is the closest thing I have had to a dad) was kind of unstable (he never hit me, but that is where I got my temper). The rest of my family either hates my guts or just ignores me (and are all ultra-conservative, and I am GAY AND I am FUCKING TRANS!!!) so I cannot count on them. My boss is the only person who cares outside of the internet, and even then we do not talk much.I am also on probation. I have been out of paid work since July of 2019. I spent my life savings on cheap drugs, cheap booze,.and cheap sex. Either that or I pissed it away gambling. I literally have nothing. And since I am on pre-trial diversion (I WAS FUCKING FRAMED, I am FROM THE MIDWEST WHAT THE FUCK DOES ANYONE EXPECT???), everyone sees my arrest and thinks I am just another junkie. Oh, not even to mention the many, MANY times I have been abused by my partners. I have not been on a date in a year, mostly because no one wants to date a tranny around here because that is all I am anymore. Nothing makes sense since I got out of high school. Yeah, I was outed and tormented and mentally scarred. But at least I knew what I needed to do. Everything was so much clearer, it is impossible to navigate anything anymore. I do not need someone to hold my hand, I just need a little extra help every now and then. Not that people know the difference.I could do it tonight, but I do not want to (not that thw hospital will help, they could not the first four times). If I could just not wake up tomorrow, that would be a dream come true. I do not want to hurt anymore. Sometimes I wish that somehow I ended up in a coma, and that I will just wake up in the hospital. Nothing will have changed, everything will make sense again. Everyone will still be around, and things will be okay again.

It has recovered very, very slightly, but I have to force myself to consume 1,000 calories a day. I do not know what happened to my appetite.When I eat, I get some throat tightness and nausea, but I am able to keep the food down.My blood pressure has also gone way up, to around 145/95. I keep getting episodes of brain fog, feel like I cannot focus on anything, and lose all interest in things. (For instance, I was re-watching WandaVision before, but then the ""brain fog"" hit and I lost interest in watching it.) I also get occasional facial ""flushing,"" where it feels like my face and forehead are hot.What is going on with me? Do any of these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? Is this some kind of psychological episode, or am I afflicted with some kind of cancer that suddenly and completely destroyed my appetite? I do not know what in the world is wrong with me. Did I reach some kind of psychological ""tipping point"" and fall over the edge? Do I need some kind of high-powered medication to get back on the right track? (Note: Not currently taking any meds, used to take Lexapro but quit 3 or 4 months ago because it was making me too tired.)Any help is appreciated, at this point I just do not know what is going on.

I know this is incredibly unrealistic and from what I am learning, it is beneficial to practice mindfulness and find enjoyment in the ordinary. I have tried creating a gratitude's list, in addition to approaching everyday events at face value, but it all feels like it is in vain.

I am tired of being invalidated, I am tired of invalidating myself.

The worst part is I actually feel these things and its real to me. Every little thing that resulted me in feeling like this was real but it feels like more should happen. Somehow none of it was enough for me to qualify feeling like this. When I was a teen I was severely bullied, as a child I was so anxious and stressed that I pulled my lashes and eyebrows out. I self harmed for years (I do not anymore). I drank and smoked weed to get rid of the pain. I was pee on peer sexually assaulted in school, drugged and sexually assaulted which was so close to being a full blown rape had not I been saved when I was 18.

35457,"Irrational fear of rabies So I know that my fear is irrational but I can’t stop thinking about it! 

At the beginning of January (I mean very beginning like 4th) I was at a store where the owner had two cats. The cat that bit was very friendly at first, was rubbing against my mom and I. My mom had playfully ruffled its head and it had swatted at her, I then went to pet it and it bit me! Looking back it the incident I know the cat was most likely just annoyed hence why it bit me. 

At the end of January I (mistakenly) decided to consult dr google about rabies. This seemed to set something off in my brain, that night I couldn’t sleep. I was terrified that I was going to die of rabies. I went to the doctors and received a tetanus shot and was told to call the owner. 

My mom called for me and the owner told her that since the cats are in a public place they have to be up to date on their shots. While this was reassuring at first, a day later I kept having what if’ thoughts. Such as “what if the lady was lying about about the cat being vaccinated”

Either way it’s now March and I’m experiencing what I think is anxiety. Every time I think about my health, my chest tightens up and it feels like I can’t breath. I’m having awful muscle twitches in my legs, arms, and eyelids. I’m also having what I think is “pains” in my left arm (not the arm I was bit by the cat).  And the newest thing is I’m getting horrible nausea to the point where I feel close to throwing up (and I haven’t thrown up in years). Even now I can’t help but wonder “what if I’m just having a long term incubation period”

I guess I’m here looking for some reassurance that I’m not going crazy or dying slowly of rabies",Anxiety

Two feral kittens were eating food my family put out for them and our cat scared them, so they ran inside the house. In the process of trying to literally herd cats, one of them bit my knuckle while I tried fishing him out of the corner. I washed it with alcohol and soap for 10 minutes.

After doing some Googling (!!!) I went to the ER two days later. I must have rabies!

After explaining the situation, the nurses and doctor were very reassuring that I probably didn't need a rabies vaccine. They said it was ultimately up to me, but she said ""in my professional opinion, I wouldn't get it."" As it was expensive and insurance might not cover it.

So I got a tetanus shot and antibiotics instead.

Tetanus shot made me feel like trash and now I've had a the subtlest, mildest of headaches for three days. It's so light I'm not even certain I have one half the time. I'm hyper aware of every muscle twitch I have. When my hands get cold I panic thinking they're going numb. I check to make sure I can still swallow.

Any day now the headache will get intense and I'll wake up to my hand being completely numb. Then I'll go back to the ER and they'll tell me there's nothing they can do because I'm dead meat. 

It happened on the 9th and all of the feral cats appear fine still. Mom and dad cat and three kittens. None rabid or dying.

But I'm still dying. And constantly on alert about my body. Does my head hurt or am I making it hurt by thinking about it so damn much?

To make it worse, I got taken off my Ativan ages ago because I switched doctors and the new one refuses to prescribe anything remotely addictive.

I've been in a very suicidal depressive cycle for about two months now, and I'm just...stuck. I have some coping mechanisms that work for my usual level of depression, but nothing seems to be helping this time. 

I'm making sure I eat semi-regularly, taking my meds, getting sleep, and trying to keep myself distracted with old hobbies (even if they're not enjoyable, it does take my mind off things for a bit). I'm currently trying to get into meditation/mindfulness at the suggestion of my therapist but it's proving to be a bit difficult (so far I've used Headspace and Calm). A solid exercise schedule seems really daunting/near impossible right now, but I'm planning on taking my dog for a walk tomorrow if it doesn't rain.

34116,"Constantly “checking” for signs of brain problem Hey, guys. So this is a little difficult to explain, so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So, a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think “there is something wrong with my brain”. Well now, it’s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/don’t have a problem, I’ve begun subconsciously “checking” every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance, I’ll skim a headline really fast online, then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didn’t carefully read it). Because I’m now “checking” every single word I read and hear, I’m constantly misreading, mishearing and misunderstanding things, because I’m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. It’s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory, which of course, is fueling my health anxiety as it further “proves” I have something wrong with me. 

Of course, occupying my mind with this causes me to make many, many mistakes which- you guessed it- fuels it more.

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop. Weird because I’ve spent more time sitting and studying in the past, but had no back issues at that time.

However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well, my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole, fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to ""live"" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me.

34337,"I've had health anxiety since 2012, i've been learning to manage it pretty well over the last couple years. Today I had a bit of a relapse so I wrote something to get my confidence back. Over the last 5 years I have had:

-Schizophrenia
-Pancreatic cancer
-Multiple Hernias
-Testicular cancer
-Urinary tract infections
-Blood clots / DVT
-Pulmonary embolism
-Heart attacks
-Angina
-Stomach Ulcers
-Misaligned vertebrae and ribs
-Meningitis 
-Bradycardia and Tachycardia 
-Brain Tumors
-TMJ
-Aching shoulders, neck, back
-GERD and food intolerances

Somehow I have survived all of these... 

My symptoms were:

-Headaches
-Insomnia
-Shortness of breath
-Palpitations
-Racing thoughts
-Indigestion 
-Tight aching muscles
-Dizziness 

My treatment for these was:

-Constantly checking pulse and breathing
-Checking for symmetry 
-pushing and prodding where I felt it hurt until it did hurt 
-Twisting and turning until I felt that symptom again
-Avoiding anything that I believed would make my symptoms worse (flying, eating certain foods, exercising too much or too little)
-and most importantly googling for the exact scenario I believed to be true e.g. 'headache above left ear associated with brain cancer' or 'sore achilles hill sign of DVT'

I have (literally) spent $1000's on:

-GP's (who always tell me the same thing)
-Physios
-Chiros
-Missed work
-Miracle cures (e.g. magnesium, vitamin B, etc...)
-Dietitians
-Ambulances

All to conquer my 'Sicknesses' 

The reality is though...

I was sick in 2012, I was truly diagnosed with Graves disease,

and although very treatable (and it has been treated).

it scared me to my core.

I became overaware of every sensation in my body and thought in my mind.

I believed that I needed to be aware to ensure I would survive.

This habit manifested itself into my true and worst alement health anxiety.

Health anxiety has stole time and experiences from me for 5 years.

It made me doubt myself.

It made me loathe myself.

It crippled me. 

However, I have been getting my life back over the last 2 years.

But it has taken effort, commitment and the realisation that this is here with me still (at least for the time being) and without consistent maintenance i'll end up back where I was.

Some days it still wins, but with each month those days get less and less.

My health anxiety no longer and will never again define who I am.

24484,"For four weeks I have had thoughts and dreams about how nobody understands what I am battling in my mind, everybody is angry and shouting at me for being so silent and useless and a burden. In these dreams I go to the bathroom, empty a bottle of pills on my hand and throw all of them down my throat. My knees get weak, I break down and then sleep. Even though I am unconscious, I see how somebody discovers me and what I did and just stands there indifferentlylike she expected it but is not surprised so she does not care.I call a therapist because these thoughts get persistent in my day. I try to not overhope since therapy is no magic, I am aware of that. An hour later, he tells me he will not work with me and I should just take pills. No therapy is needed here since I am already unfixable. I leave him crushed, baffled and angry.I visit a friend the first time since the pandemic for three days. We planned this for three months now. The first two days go absolutely pleasantly. We talk and laugh, play cards (Exploding kittens and Durak) and drink a little, we watch movies (Disney's Luca and Netflix's Ratched). Third day, he changes. When I talk to him, he always just monotously answers ""Okay."" I try to tell him, I am just trying to smalltalk and that his indifference feels cold to me, and he responds that he does not have to be interested in everything I say. That hurt. I go quiet. I do not know what to do or say to him. As a kid I was bullied for being an odd one out in school and by my family. that is why I tend to go silent so to not annoy anyone and become invisible. Then he gets angry at me for ignoring him. I get quieter and secretly cry in the bathroom. The visit ends. My mind is confused and broken.One week later I think ""whatever."", start to ignore my feelings and my hurts by taking SSRI again. I still have a good batch of unused ones from when my maternal grandfather died and I developed a (now partially overcome) hypochondriasis which was fed by me actually having a for six months unrecognised infection of my CNS. So since nobody wants to help me to learn how to deal with these emotions and my suicidal thoughts, I might aswell just take these fake blisses of happiness. It is the only option I have. Fake smile, no cry, here we go.Third pill in I get headaches throughout the day. My sleep is disrupted, I wake up several times in the night. Even though in the morning I wake up rested I am awfully tired at day. I have to lay down for half an hour in the afternoon or I would crash hard. I am not even sleeping, just laying there with my eyes closed. Throughout the day it sometimes feels like I am not even there. While reading I see my arms and it feels like they are some weird noodles that do not belong to my body. it is as someone is standing behind me holding the book. My head feels as if it is floating in a gelatine of air. Sometimes it even is hard to read the words in the book. But why should I be concerned? it is better this way. I am tranquilized.Fifth pill in, today. I realize how many friends I tried to talk to about my struggles and how every single one of them told me in the end that they cannot handle that part of me or straight up do not care. I am not even sure if there is any friend who would realize that I am gone if I would be offing myself right now. I think that they would realize that I am not responding to any chat messages after a while. But after that why would they care to investigate any further. It would seem like I left (or ignoring them) and they would forget about me.that is where I am right now. In my head I am walking through a ghost town. A town that never lived. A town that is made of gray and is shone upon by a misty moon. A town that has empty houses for those friends that will never come. A town that is filled with the graves of all the people who I pushed away, who distanced themselves, who I lost. Here I am, a lifeless wind howling through my empty mind.

Other depression symptoms — such as difficulty concentrating and lack of motivation — can make decision-making even harder.

I did not know this, as I can be #indecisive quiet a bit when I think about it, but I only thought to look it up yesterday when I mentioned I was to a friend...

21034,"This year has been many things, each month having its moments. With this month, being the moment of change. I have lost job after job, I wasted my money on my addiction from bottle to bottle. I lost my relationship I said I cherished so much. I misused my finances and the help offered. I let everything go including my health. I decided I wanted better and to be who I have needed to be all this time. I have a job now, I found God and go to church, I take care of my health and go out of my ways to find chances to mature more and more every day. I am making this because I am broke. My cars registration is past due, and the title is not in my name and cannot be because the old owner title hopped and I cannot reach him nor the previous previous owner. I got a warning today for that and I no longer can drive to work. It will surely cost a little something. I could not even pay rent this month or my part in electricity. I have a phone bill too coming up, along with car insurance, and even if I had my car handled I cannot even afford the gas to get to work and back. I am at the end of my wits right now. Not even three weeks ago I could easily talk to my gf and Id feel better, but she is not here anymore. And we spoke the other day and she seemed like she cares and believes I changed. She just said she needs a little more time to see things the same again. Honestly I want to continue to do better everyday, but the hole I put myself in seems more like an unclimbable dried up well. I made a go fund me but I do not expect that to work. If you look at my post history you can see the desperation for it to work though.

A guitarist locking himself up in a room and practicing 10 hours a day. A lifter who devotes his whole life into lifting weights and building muscle. A youtuber whose content captivates masses? Yeah, that could not be me.As the title suggests, my life is kind of crap. I am 21 years old, just finishing my degree in American studies.

After having a very fun depressive few months.. years on and off I really and I mean really want to get rid of this clingy stubborn crap stain of a companion.I have tried doing that by trying to enjoy life more. And you know I am really fucking happy to admit that I think I am almost there. But its like I am sitting on the edge of a cliff and when I look down I can see the type of person I want to be but becoming that person feels like I am going to have to jump off and here is why. I want to be able to wear clothes that look nice and make me feel nice when wearing them. I want to have a better relationship with my parents and sibling. I want to focus on my hobbies like art and writing. Start cooking and doing it more often instead of just eating cup noodles. I want to start enjoying train rides to cities looking at the Opera house at sunset, meeting new people, having lots of plants, doing things that make me feel at peace. man, I just really want to start enjoying life.But every time I do things that I have always wanted to do I remember why I did not do it before and what stopped me. Every time I wear clothes I am excited to wear I keep thinking how bad they look on me. I remember looking through my clothes and putting together outfits I might be able to wear if lockdown gets any better but after every outfit deep down I did not like how my body looked on all of them. I have gained weight and it feels even worse when my mum comments on how fat I look. I am 57 kilos and 163 cm which might be chubby but personally would not go on to say I am fat yeah know? however to my mum, it is beyond every time I come to have a conversation with her, she comments on my weight, my hair, my looks. I remember she used to comment a lot on my grades but after I got A's and made it into a competitive school she stopped and went on other things, the constant shame of grades had driven me into trying so damn hard at school thinking maybe if I get better grades my mum will get off my back. But its as if the more I try to make her proud the more ways she finds to get disappointed. But she is my mum, she is toxic sometimes but I know that she cares and certain times she shows it. but it is hard. it is hard having conversations with my family. There so.... strict and hard to talk to. So judgemental. So overdramatic. Whenever I talk to them I get reminded why I did not. My mum always says I am just avoiding my family I say that I am busy but the truth is I just want to have a nice time with them but I am scared. I am scared that they will say something mean and either ill have to pretend it does not bother me just to maintain, peace or ill let it get to me and get emotional. Whenever I do art, write poems do things that I like I regret doing it because I simply do not have time. I barely have time. School takes up most of my time, it is like I have no free time. Every time I do have free time I study. Study, study, study. Even though I am well aware it will not mean anything to my parents. it is like second nature. I cannot stop thinking about school. I go tutoring in the city, so aesthetic train rides to the city? Yeah reminds me of all the hours I spend on Saturday doing math. it is just that. When I start getting better, all I can see are my flaws. I am emotional, a workaholic, stressed all the damn time, insecure. I get so disappointed, Soon enough before I know it. All the motivation I have to get better disappears. And I am back to square one. I think one of the first steps to getting better is understanding I am very flawed but what after? And how do i get past this? I want to get better for myself, for my mum to stop worrying about me, so i stop getting annoyed at my little brother, being a bother to my friends. I really want to stop hating life because to be honest I have got so many good things i want to look forward too, so many good people i love. Yet deep down i *always* get worse, *i always get dissapointed, i always get fucking tired of life all over again* I want this time to last. How do i look at my flaws and not hate myself and get depressed all over again? How can I look at my flaws and still be... ok?",Depression

I am asking what I should do as I cannot live with the fact I did this especially as I was already suicidal.I went out with friends and invited a friend I met on a dating app that I had known previously and was in town visiting, we got drunk and since she drove I told her she could stay at my place, prior to this night I had recently reconnected with friends after disappearing for months during a mental health episode and things looked up for once.This Is where I completely fuck up and I cannot believe I did this. After drinking with some friends at my place we cuddle and put on a movie, we were all over each the entire night prior to being drunk too, she specifically told me she did not want to have sex because she was going through a lot and recently attempted, I genuinely wanted to respect that and not make her uncomfortable so at this time I accepted nothing would happen although I did hope in the back of my head something would. We were cuddling and she told me she would take off her shirt because it was hot, I told her I understand and that I did not want to make her do anything she did not want to (although in the end I did). She then said that that makes her want to do it more (have sex) and I insisted I did not want to make her do anything she is uncomfortable with I should have stopped everything here in retrospect but given I was also intoxicated but its not an excuse. She layed on me and I played with her chest we then told each other some pretty vulnerable stuff like how I am a virgin.She said things like I cannot believe someone as handsome and amazing as you has not been with anyone etc. I told her I have a lot of trauma that made me shy around girls. I am not entirely sure what happened next but we made out a little and she ended up laying over my legs on her stomach I assumed she wanted to watch the movie. I began touching her more aggressively and took off her underwear the entire time I did not realize she was passed out asleep I thought she may have closed her eyes because as I touched her more intimately (but never putting anything inside her) she started to breath heavier. In hindsight should have not took this as consent. I stopped to get up, and saw her eyes were closed so I put a blanket over her it still did not click what I had done.She then asked a couple seconds after tucking her in why she had no underwear. I immediately realized what I had done was not consensual I started to apologize the best I could while intoxicated. But she was still half asleep. After apologizing profusely and waking her up she became very empathetic telling me that it was okay and she will not tell anyone and that I did not know she was asleep. I tried to tell her that it does not matter what I did was fucked up but somehow ended up with her embracing me and encouraging me to talk about the trauma I mentioned to her earlier so I did it was weirdly therapeutic and I was so confused because I just did something horrible to her.She ended up sobering up and to my protest she drove and I bought her food and told her how sorry I was agin and if there was anything I can do let me know before she dropped me back at my place. I stupidly texted her after not sleeping at all that She should let me take her on a proper date because she said she wanted to see each other before she left town I know I am a stupid idiot but I texted her that, she obviously declined and I knew she felt differently than when it initially what happened as she was probably sobering up and processing what happened.I told her I understand and that it was selfish of me to ask. She then sent me a longer text later in the day and it was that she felt violated and that I took advantage of her which I absolutely did. Despite that She told me that she genuinely thinks I am a good friend and hopes I thrive one day and get help but that she has to block me for her own mental health. I replied with a really long apology that I hope was sincere and understanding but it did not go through as I was expecting.I am not sure what to do now I have been a mess the entire day, I feel so fucking horrible for what I did its eating me alive.

I live around 4.5 hours away from university and my dad picked me up and drove me home as soon as I had the covid scare so I wouldn't have to quarantine in the Quarantine and Isolation Housing dorm. I'm staying home for the week to recover from whatever I have and to see my doctor in person.   
My professors all let me know what I'd be missing and where I can access work so I don't fall behind. It's so great to see my family again but I'm melancholy because I'm so stressed about missing school and sports practice plus my car and most of my belongings are at my school. The health center, res life, and the dean's office all know the situation but I'm worried that me missing class will come back to bite me when I return to school. College was already extremely stressful for me, especially with my busy sports schedule where I practice 3 nights in a row from 11 pm-12:30 am.   
Is there any advice or coping mechanisms you can give me to help me get over this stress?

51801,"I’m worried I’m second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn’t follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don’t post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.",Personality disorder

21490,"Hi, I am in my early 20s right now and when i was a teen and up to recently i was depressed and borderline suicidal but i never told anyone because I was scared and internalize every negative feeling I get (which I am currently working on). The past year or so I have found an amazing friend group online that I love and I have been dating one of them for quite a while now but I have an issue. They keep making edgy jokes about suicide. I do not mind the jokes themselves since its just them being edgy but sometimes it gets a lot for me when the joke is just ""hey (name) you should go kill yourself or something!"" 20 times in a minute. As I mentioned, I am no longer suicidal but i definitely have had moments the past couple of months where I have been overwhelmed with sadness and wanted to die. Either way, my main issue is that the person who does this the most is my partner who i absolutely love so much and at this point jokes like that can ruin my day and give me extremely much anxiety but I am terrified of telling him because I do not want to either ruin his fun or want him to act all different with me. I know he will not be mad at me or anything but I am mostly scared that this is something that could completely change our relationship since I would become like an emotional baggage (and he already has enough of that)...I have mentioned to him before that I sometimes deal with a lot of anxiety and I used to be really bad with it but never anything else. How could i possibly tell him all of this???? Should i just try my best to ignore it all or leave our chat when it goes on?? How do i tell someone I have been suicidal in the past?",Suicidal

My psychiatrist put me on 1600mg Lithium and 6mg risperdone coming out of hospital in 2016. Now I am at 1200mg Lithium and 1mg Risperdone.

My new NP who oversees my meds and mood seems like a knowledgeable guy and ran it by me to see if we could try new meds. He wants to make sure the side effects of my current meds aren’t affecting me too badly.

I am concerned because these are the only meds I have been on since being hospitalized. Lithium and risperdone are my so called “cocktail” that work with me.

I'm on 1200mg of lithium carbonate, 250mg Divalproex and 150mg Bupropion HCL XL every other day. I've noticed a good improvement on this cocktail, most recently upped the dose of lithium to 1200mg and I felt like I was doing better, but it's been 3 months and I've had 2 episodes since the increase....These episodes are usual at this time of year so it didn't cause them, but they're still there, a bit more manageable and definitely not ruining my life like before, but I do not feel like a normal functioning human being. I'm still experiencing mania, but I'm able to stop myself from spending excess money and I am able to notice the energy I'm expending so I can force myself to relax here and there so I'm not deprived. I still sleep less, but enough to function so that's good. I can't stop myself from picking up my phone and googling everything on the planet that comes to mind...I feel like I have ADD or something, literally no focus at all which is not good for work. I still have significant periods of anxiety and stress about nothing and I'm finding this hard to manage, and the depression is still there, but my body no longer feels like cement, although I'm usually tired even after sleeping 10-14hrs. I can still force myself to get up and do stuff like clean, shower, etc. But I'm extremely miserable about it and everything else that doesn't involve sleeping., I don't cry omw to work, during work and while showering anymore, I don't have ""those scary thoughts"" anymore and I can keep a gym schedule although during my depressive periods the amount of gym sessions I get in are significantly less. 
Is this it or should I keep trying to find a better state to be in?  I mean I can live with it, but it sucks to go through this rollercoaster of emotions and energy expending and depleting, even if it's just a mid-sized one. I cancel a lot of plans on friends often because the way I feel when making them is not how I feel when the date arrives, I still have these insane urges to make plans with people and go out and socialize, shop, google search like mad and try new stuff, I still sleep less and more depending on what stage I'm in, I still overstress over everything and panic, I still feel drained and prefer to be alone and do nothing for a month or so straight.

50997,"Recovered, but it's too late I suffered from severe AVPD from my late teens into my early twenties. During this time, I cut off my old school friends and then didn't go to uni. In fact, I pretty much became a recluse. 

I eventually started to recover when I was about 22. I'm now in my late twenties, and though I feel I've overcome most AVPD symptoms, I feel like I am too old to make new friends. I've managed to sort of reconnect with 2 school friends, but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different. 

I really feel like I would've made my lifelong friends at uni, but I didn't make it there. I don't know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done. 

As I've recovered from AVPD, I've realised I'm not that weird of a person, and I can actually get on with people fine. But those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed. It now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun I am, it doesn't matter, because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesn't want anymore.

I had to sell a lot of my belongings that helped me cope with my depression, such as my laptop and PS5. 

My partner is a fantastic person and the moments I get to spend with him everyday are a blessing. He has similar issues,  but I insisted he kept his computer since that's his lifeline. On top of that, he has numerous social circles who adore him.

I've been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing, and it stings when I'm awake at night sad and alone,  and I hear him talking to one of his many friend groups. They play games, have fun, just hang out. He'll do this all night, and I have to sleep and wake up to him having fun.

I asked him to keep his belongings and I love that he has friends, but I just get so upset that he has things that I just cannot have - a loving family, friends who would never replace him, games he can play - it makes me so irrevocably depressed that I just can't have those things for some reason. I have autism, ADHD and social anxiety and I try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day, it isn't his problem. I want him to be happy but I'm upset that he can do these things, which is shitty of me to even feel.

46492,"My new insurance considers my meds ""preventative"" So I thought this was interesting and also maybe a little sign of attitudes towards mental health changing.  I got new insurance and was looking through the list of ""preventative"" medications, the ones covered at 100% and don't cost you anything, to see if anything I was taking was on the list.  (It never is, but always worth a check.)

First I searched depakote.  To my surprise it was listed, but as an epilepsy medication.  My first thought was whether or not they knew I wouldn't be taking it for epilepsy and I would get away with getting it for free!

Next I searched for Cymbalta, and it was there!  Listed as an antidepressant.  In fact they had nearly all your antidepressants on there.  Lithium is on the list and even some anti anxiety meds.

Sure enough, when I filled my prescriptions, they were free.

I mean it makes good business sense.  I am more expensive if I end up in the hospital.  Just like quitting smoking drugs are frequently covered because you're a lower risk if you quit.

For some reason it just made me feel good.  Like hey, it's just an illness and we know you need meds to keep it under control.  No big deal.  Or something.  It also made me very people for everyone under this plan because while I do not currently have any issues paying for my meds, I know what it's like to be in that position and it's horrible.

Unfortunately when it strikes she becomes extremely cold and cruel. She walks away from me mid conversation, locks herself in the bedroom, tells me to go away, not touch her, calls me names, says cruel things about me, creates fabrications and refuses to get out of bed and try to do anything to help her depression. She frequently tells me to leave her when in this state and that I would be better off without her.Once the spell is over she is back to her happy Loving self with cuddles and kisses and words of affirmation.Now I understand that these things are related to depression, but my concern is the outright toxic behavior. She says that it is because her depression makes her push people away, but I am starting to question if this is actually depression or just an excuse to be toxic.I understand I could have posted this on relationship advice and I might also do that, but the reason I am posting it here is to get insight from people that have and are sympathetic to depression. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Depression or toxic?",Depression

20853,"Hi,I cannot sleep because I miss my dog, so I am writing to keep my mind occupied. Here is a little background about me. I have never been popular with women. I do not know why, but they typically do not find something about me attractive. I am not hideous, and I do not think I am an unattractive person. I treat people with kindness, and I am not socially awkward but for whatever reason, I have never had much luck with women. I have had a few successes with women that did not work out. When I was younger, it did not really bother me because I figured I would eventually meet someone. Now, I am 40 and it is impossible. I had accepted the fact that it was not going to happen a couple of years ago. Sure, I did not want that outcome, but I made peace with it. I have always loved dogs. They are truly are the best creatures on the planet. A couple of years ago, I took my savings that had been saved over several years of working and bought a house. It was a nice comfortable modest house with a nice yard and I adopted a beautiful dog. he is so sweet and loving. He is my best friend. I was still sad about not having a significant other in my life, but hey. I at least had my dog. Then I made the biggest career mistake I have ever made and left a good company for more money (and perceived security) because the economy was not doing well. That job was terrible, and I suffered from depression and anxiety about it. I was unable to find another job that paid well in that city and now I am in one of the largest cities in the country. it is a fine city, but impossible to own an actual single family home with a yard. Everyone lives in apartments and condos. I do not have a problem with it, but the dense urban environment was not good for my young and large dog. He was so used to being able to chase squirrels and run around our yard. He was so happy. I held out home that my company would allow me to work remotely because we had been doing it successfully so I could move back and buy a house for my dog. Sadly, they are going to require us to return to the office, and I knew then that I would not be able to afford a house for my dog. He was really is miserable in my apartment. We went on walks a lot, but there is very minimal green space here and his entire personality changed. He went from being happy all of the time to being sad. I made the difficult decision to rehome him this weekend. he is back in the city we came from with a nice and loving family that has a beautiful house with a yard. He instantly lit up when he saw the yard and took off running and playing. I knew it was the best decision for him, but I miss him so much. He really was the only reason my life is worth living. Not having my dog is not the only reason I am depressed. I have been lonely for a long time, but my dog was literally the only reason I smiled at all. To be honest, I would have probably killed myself had it not been for having him. Now, I find myself in this apartment alone and looking at pictures of my dog playing in my old yard and thinking about what I lost due to my mistake of leaving that job. The hard part is knowing I will never get that back. Because I just recently started this new job, I cannot really leave without screwing up my resume. it is not a bad company. it is actually a good job, but I do not understand why they will not allow me to work remotely. That being said, it is not my company, so it is what it is. I just really miss my dog. He was really the only good thing in my life. I am giving myself 3 months to allow time to hopefully have this feeling pass. I doubt it will because I have struggled with it for years, but I still have some hope that my life might change. Maybe I will meet my dream woman on the subway to work tomorrow? Maybe my company will allow me to work remotely and then my new special someone and I can move, buy a house and have dogs. that is really all I want. it is amazing how even something minor like that seems impossible, but that is all I really want. I will start this week putting my financial affairs in order like a will, etc and try to enjoy the next few months to the extent possible. I have a camping trip with my dogs new family in about a month where I will get to day goodbye to my dog. I truly home something changes in the next few months. What I have learned is that I do not really want to die. I just want a life that I cannot have. And not having that life means my future will be lonely and miserable. Short of something miraculous happening in the next few months, I will be gone. I just hope people will remember me well. I am not perfect, but I hope I am remembered as a nice person that loves animals. Rehomed my dog in preparation.",Suicidal

I am a hopeless person, I trie to be nice to others even when they insult, hate me for absolutely no reasons and I hate myself for it, and my dad told me that when I was a child I almost died, I was sick and instead of taking me to a doctor, the woman who gave brith to me choose instead to go shopping, and my dad was against it but he did not want to start a fight so he let her go, while I was suffocating on the arms of my dad(and to this day, my dad and I are the only who knows about it) , funny right?

Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was Hispanic/Puerto Rican. They divorced when I was young (Stevie Wonder could see that one coming) and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failure/coward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and I was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned and has a foreign accent.

One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

16558,"Hello, I am seeking advice for my depression/addiction. Growing up, I was bullied until the end of high school and my strict religious parents created a very stressful and traumatic upbringing at home. I have always had an unshakeable feeling of low self worth and I always feel like nobody likes me. I always have to go above and beyond for people to like me but others seemingly do nothing and have people adore them. In addition, I have an over obsessive addiction to things that stimulate me. It ranges from food, movies/tv, theme parks, etc (no alcohol or drug addictions). Really, just anything that prevents me from sitting with myself and my thoughts. Literally, I cannot do anything without simultaneously eating a snack, or listening to music or a podcast or something to stimulate me and make me feel happy. I am addicted to this self induced false sense of happiness because its the only time I really ever feel happy. Over the years, I have made excuses/goals to help me with my depression and low self-esteem. First, I blamed it on my weight, then my lack of education, then my finances, then being single and alone, etc. Present day, I have my own place, I got fit, completed multiple degrees, have a great paying career, I am in a 6 year committed relationship, and I have even mended my strained relationship with my family. Honestly, I have a great life and I have run out of excuses. HOWEVER, my self worth is as low as ever and I still feel like people do not like me (or think the ones that do, will leave me the second I do something wrong or upset them). I have been seeing a therapist for 2 years and it has helped me to better understand the root of my behaviors but no luck finding a solution. I am continuously told to try positive affirmations but no matter how much I repeat to myself you are smart, you are worthy,etc, or how many lists i write with my positive traits, nothing changes. I am not suicidal or anything like that, and when I reflect, like I stated earlier, I am aware I have a great life but the thought of living the rest of my life and never being truly happy or loving myself is so scary and I do not know what to do.Anyone in a similar situation or have advice?

We were worthless to him and that is how I still feel. When it is finally over you are met with bodies in the hallway. The fear he gave me never left.

14271,"I am unemployed for several months and was working in a fairly huge company had people who respected me and had a huge name in my company and good amounts of contacts and then I got a new manager who was very hard to deal with that person literally changed every person who I was connected with first they all started ignoring me(even people who I helped gettjng salaries raised,helped them with their work taught them different things) and I could not bear any of that so I went to my superior with request to change dept because of this manager's behaviour but this guy told me ""work if you want to work or get out"" then I adjusted with these people for months then all of a sudden I got a call from HR saying you have complain against you from your manager which was so false and it was clearly framed against me (my manager went ahead and manipulated my previous works to prove their point) I was blamed for things that I did not even do then I brought my evidence and proved it all wrong and then later that month I get another call from HR saying come and sign your resignation your contract is terminated as you have done a huge fraud with the company I was shocked I was so loyal to the company and worked so hard but I just got shit upon by a c**t who came in just recently well there was no investigation what so ever and even my people who worked under me and my coworkers pretty much all of them cut their ties with me and no one responded to any of my msgs they read all of them but no one replied now fast forward I applied to many companies and worst part is it is the pandemic now and finding work is very hard and what really makes me feel like ending it all is that I applied to different jobs in my working industry gave interviews and got very good responses I was expecting offer letters from them but to my surprise I found out that each and every place I applied to some person had a connection to my old company and the people who framed me .Therefore I am not being hired anywhere since my name got destroyed in my old company and pretty much none of my ""so called contacts"" have even replied to my msgs and some even blocked me At this point I feel like my careers destroyed every day feels like a standstill and I feel like ending it all but I just think of my family and how hurt they will be and tbh I am afraid of doing it, I guess every human is but yeah its nuts how life can change in a blink of an eye and I do know some people have it far worse than me but man this sucks and anyone who has read my msg this far thank you it means alot because I have no one to cry to or discuss with I am all alone and helpless but idk how can some people be so cruel that they would want to destroy other peoples career sometimes I feel that I was the mistake for even being born in this world but ah man ffs I am done ranting Well I hope no one goes through what I did My work life getting destroyed",Depression
34361,"Testicular Cancer I'm like 90% sure I have testicular cancer.. basically around 3 months ago, i got a sharp pain in my testicle, immediately I got worried as I never have pain there.. so I looked it up and saw testicular cancer, I was shaking, etc. The next day or so I was experiencing symptoms of testicular cancer.. like abdominal pain, chest pain, etc almost every day for like 1 and a half months, so fast forward January I went to the ER because the chest pains were pretty bad, same with abdominal pain, etc. They did an EKG, chest x-ray and a nurse did a physical exam on me.. so for the EKG my heart rate was kinda high, also my blood pressure was high (but it always has been so not really worried), then I had a Chest X-Ray after I did that and got the results back saying ""all clear"".. my chest pain stopped like 10 minutes later still had abdominal pain tho, they did a blood test which also came back good but TC can't be detected in a common blood test. 

After that I got a physical exam and testicular exam, the testicular exam the nurse only examined the sides and front.. by the way I have a lump on the top of my testicle, didn't really tell her about it though but she said everything seemed fine.

So still almost everyday I worry that I have TC.. i'm scared they could of missed something on the Chest X-Ray. I'm thinking about going back to the ER soon and getting a testicular ultrasound. Also right now i'm having headaches, fever and my necks been hurting when I move it for about a week..

11145,"I feel like I have lost my humanity. I feel like an empty she will drifting through space and time, nothing more and nothing less. There is no soul, there is no me...what am I? Am I an amalgamation of chemical components working in unison to produce this thing we call consciousness, or am I something more? The more I live and the more I think, the more I know the former is true. We are chemical systems with an imperative to continue existing forever, every choice, every thought, every reaction was preprogrammed, free will does not exist.Every problem my thinking solves just causes further dilemma. Each dilemma deepens the existential dread. I yearn for love, but love does not exist. Love was a lie, love was a fairytale and a marketing scheme used to exploit the people. Love is a chemical reaction, another preprogrammed reaction that drives us to reproduce, to continue existing forever. No two people love each other forever, the feelings fade and time drives them apart. I have seen it countless times, so why do I expect any different? Why do I still dream? Why do I cling to a lie so urgently? Does this mean there is something more? I wonder, and then I realize there is not. I realize its the same reason I crave intimacy and connection, why we despise being alone, its more biological imperatives instilled within us to increase our chances of survival. We are social creatures, we evolved this way because it was the most effective strategy. I crave for that which I have never had, only because I was wired to crave it in the first place.I think about my estranged relationship with family, I think about how my father will soon die and all we will leave between us is painful memories and regret. I feel a slight sinking inside of me, just for a moment those old emotions rise within me, but just as quickly as they come, they go and again I am left with emptiness. I quickly remember that none of it matters, when he is gone it will be like I never existed in his perspective, for his perspective will seize to exist. The same will soon happen to me. The feelings fade because I remember they do not exist. I remember that they too are just chemical reactions firing off inside my brain. They mean nothing, the emotion is not real. It existed because it was imperative to my survival that I feel love for my parent, just as with every human life. Its funny how I wish I could go back to when I felt human, to when I felt alive. I miss feeling, I miss when life was still a mystery, to those days where I was not a jaded husk. I stared into the abyss and saw only blackness. Those painful days where you wish the pain would leave forever, you soon realize those days were still better than the days you thought you wanted. Careful what you wish for.I wonder, why does life want to live? Why does life fight so hard in a universe where all the odds are stacked against it, where the very intrinsic functions act to destroy it? why does it adapt and arrange itself in way to keep going? Well, maybe its because it does not know any better. Nothing matters, nothing is real",Suicidal
18091,"I am having raging suicidal thoughts as I type this. I am queer and have a loving girlfriend, but unemployed since the pandemic hit. I lost many friends along the way and it made me wonder the following:Am I a bad person? Well, I could say I am an alright person but one who makes bad decisions when in awful circumstances. I tend to self sabotage when things go too well, I used to opt out of many gatherings because the social anxiety affected me greatly.However, there is one particularly important friend which I lost along the way. This friendship was a healthy one, and throughout our 5 years of knowing each other, there was not a single moment we had a fight that lasted over a day. In fact, we barely fought. We knew each other so well, we celebrated each other's wins, we cried when the other cried. I loved her so much and I always dreamt we would be friends till our hair turned grey.But something happened during the pandemic which broke our friendship. In retrospect it was INCREDIBLY petty and dumb, but I guess my reaction to it was so out of character to her that it made her change her mind about me completely. All of us were cooped up at home on lockdown, and during that time Singaporeans (us) were not allowed to meet anyone outside of the household. I come from a deeply dysfunctional family and trust me, the atmosphere at home is not something I want to describe in detail because it would just bring back very painful memories. Basically I was not mentally great, and I felt very alone and unwanted.During my birthday, my friend wished me via IG(photo montage) and DM. I missed her terribly and I felt so so SO lost without her. It was 3 months that I had not met this particular friend. In a way, it was my mistake for depending on her for my happiness, I mean, we are both adults so why did I cling on to the notion that my friends would save me from the catastrophe which was my mental health and basically, general home life? Fast forward a month later, I found out she delivered birthday presents to this guy who was her friend, a guy I could not stand. A fellow cohort graduate, This guy was, for some odd reason, fine with my friend but despised me. We did not click, and let us just say he intentionally blocked certain projects from me because he did not like me. I wish I could say I was a bitch to him or gossiped about him, or said anything mean, but I never did. he just had a natural inkling to dislike me. Our cohort was infamous for this type of childish behaviour, so my best guess was that he heard a rumor about me and believed it. Though he never told my friend about any of this because HE KNEW we were tight. So weird. Regardless, I got mad. I felt neglected and forgotten. I wondered how important I was to her if she could send him physical gifts but nothing my way. I felt like I deserved something more since we WERE close friends. When I asked her why she made this decision, she said she felt bad for HIM because he was complaining how lonely and sad he felt during lockdown. The irony was so thick like toffee, I blew up. See? see how stupid and circumstantial this whole thing is? I wanted something, ANYTHING to make me feel wanted and my own close friend could not see that. We sent each other novel-length texts trying to justify our actions(for over an hour), until I decided to block her for a minute or two so we could cool down. She was offended and hurt by this, and instead of waiting for an explanation, she blocked me on all forms of social media and never spoke to me again. We have not spoken since last year and I am still heartbroken about it. I have apologised to her multiple times, telling her how wrong I was for reacting that way, that it was purely circumstantial because of well...EVERYTHING (isolation, family trauma, dysfunction at home, existing mental illness, unemployment, sending presents to a whole ass bully) but she did not accept my apologies. I still think about her nearly every other day. I thought she was my soulmate in a way but apparently our friendship was as flexible as glass. The thing is, I am aware I made mistakes. I quickly got myself a counsellor after the incident and spoke to her on zoom during lockdown. I tried to make changes to myself to be the best version of me if we could meet again next time, but, I just feel like I can never be forgiven. I have spent years struggling with my own self-doubt, self-esteem, anxiety and chronic depression, and I honestly really thought I hit the jackpot when I met this friend. She was patient and non-judgemental, and all those years we had as friends, I never trauma dumped on her, or at least I thought I did not? If she could have told me if I made mistakes along the way I would have changed everything. I wish I saw the signs.Now that it is been a year, I feel like there is a gaping hole in my chest that has yet to be filled. Even my girlfriend cannot fill it. I feel like there is something inherently wrong and damaged with me after I lost this one friend. I do have other good friends, it is true, but losing one, just one, has ruined my outlook on life and myself as a person. So right now, I just need some help figuring out if I am a fucked up, unfixable wackjob or if I should try to reconnect with her again.or did I just make bad friendships that could not survive a pandemic?

22244,"I had anxiety since age 11 and ruined childhood because of that. I had derealization and crazy anxiety attacks where I cried. I had no idea what was happening and could not really tell my parents what was wrong. Dad was an alcoholic but a happy type of drinker, mom worked very, very hard and got hooked on pills and occasional alcohol. We lived in a house with my grandparents that I loved very much. My mother made go to different school at 10 that I hated. It was further away, teachers sucked and schoolmates made it clear they do not like outsiders. I had a friend there that was most hated in my class therefore I was unpopular too. My dream was to leave that hell and study electronics. 5 years of torture left... But to be honest last two years were much better I got a PC and had something to talk about with others and also realized that so called friend was a liar and manipulated me. My mother did not want me to study electronics but chose another school instead. I was broken. I suffered from stomach issues and puked every morning. Classmates and friends were great though. The anxiety went away and depression started... The derealization was mostly gone but the depression kicked in and I started to loose interest in my hobbies. what is happening? I do not know maybe I am just sad that I am fat. So I lost weight. No that was not it and no my mother said I look horrible because I am skinny. I was always something I her eyes... You do not go out, you play too much, you read too much, other kids speak 7 languages, they have good grades, they do sport.... Depression destroyed my concetration and my ability to learn. At age 18 I had my first suicide thought. I was like: What the hell are you even thinking about?I wanted to become a detective so I went to law school and lasted 3 months. My world crumbled. Now what?? I was unemployed for months and parents hated me because I was a disgrace. I found a corporate job with help of my sisters husband. I lasted 3 days. Back to school I guess... I had no interest in math so tech schools were out of the question. I applied for social work and finished it. Somewhere in the middle I got an idea: I will learn math and apply for IT school and that is what I did. I worked hard whole summer. Then first semester started and I almost went crazy. It was hard to concentrate and I felt like my whole reputation depended on this. I will show everyone I am not dumb and lazy just a depressed lost fuck. I got a bachelors degree and realized corporate world is hell. In my new job I lasted three weeks before I got fired. They saw my complete lack of interest. My father told me I am a dickhead and I am a lost because. I wanted to jump out of the 10th floor. I still had people to live for. Dad died shortly after and my sister gave me a contact on her colleague that worked in IT withing the police in my city. They were looking for IT guys. I got the job I was really happy! I am still happy for the last 3.5 years. My sister tells me that without her I would accomplish nothing and she Is the only reason I have that job. This kills my self esteem. They (sister and her husband) are succesful and have money and they make fun of me for being a looser with no girlfriend. I never had a girlfriend. My only (girl)friend is and escort that I visit every two weeks. She was one of the reason I never killed myself. We really like each other and are good friends. I started with medication two years ago and it was the best decision. I discovered I am bipolar just like my mother but I have less serious version of it. Sport helped me and also a little discomfort. Try to go out. If you hate places with lots of people and loud music that is great. Do it. Your brain needs to get used to these stimuli. If you hate your job there is a chance you hate your city too and maybe your whole social circle. Just move to a smaller city and start over. that is my last resort if everything fails.

After leaving the hospital, I started to make plans to move out of state. I moved very far away and stayed far away for years. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I had to move back. I know logically, I probably will not ever see him again, but I am terrified of running into him. I am having a hard time leaving the house and going out in public for fear that I may run into him. I also fear that I will run into a mutual friend. Idk I just kind of fear that I will run into anyone from my past during that time of my life. I basically had to cut all communication off from everyone I knew when the situation happened in the first place.So I have locked myself up in my house. I keep telling my husband that it is a mistake that we moved here but he is telling me that I am behaving irrationally and that I need to to deal with it. I do not know how.

However it’s like the obsessions creep back in and my brain won’t stop cycling over a person that I know isn’t healthy and a POS. I know they’re intrusive thoughts. 

I know what I need to do to combat them. But damn it’s a fight every day. I don’t remember having this fight 10 years ago. That being said - we are fighters. We can do this. I’m surrounding myself with people who know me and love me.

46237,"Was misdiagnosed and put on antidepressants, which lead to ""mania"". Not entirely sure of my ""proper"" diagnoses. I just didn't have a manic episode like most of you experience, I think, so I don't know if I believe it. 

After struggling with severe depressive episodes throughout my life that have caused me to drop out of school, lose nearly all the jobs I've worked, ect. ect., (over 10 years of bullshit) I decided to get some proper medical help. 

Within first day I started taking the antidepressants I experienced a pretty significant shift in my mood. Energy, talking, felt good. Felt ""high"", I guess. I didn't get any sleep that night though, and for the next three days I don't know if I got any more than an hour of sleep a night. 

On each of those next days I felt like I was detached from my body a lot, like I was watching myself. I started pacing in my room a lot, and felt compelled to talk or else like... idk I felt like something bad would happen. I had no appetite, my mind was moving way to fast to focus on anything, let alone food. I was totally incapacitated by anxiety, and stayed in my apartment the whole time, where I feel like my roommates were all looking at me funny and put off by how weird I felt I was acting (which is funny because when I asked them about those few days they just told me I was reallly talkative but otherwise they weren't freaked out or anything). Weirdest experience was what felt like a stabbing/lightning sensation in my brain. I reallly don't know how to explain that one. In the end I started praying to God to relieve me of my suffering which was weird because I'm an athiest. 

I didn't take the antidepressants on the fifth day, and most of this stuff ceased shortly after, though I continued to not sleep very much (like 5 hours a night?) for a little while.

I didn't contact my doctor for a few months because I thought everything was fine. I suddenly started cutting and dying my own hair a lot, got multiple piercings and tattoos, jumped fair and doing all kinds of other kinda fun wreck-less shit (never done any of these things before). Drinking a lot and being really social. Started working out, got a dream job, started dating again, felt like my life was getting back in order.

Then I just sorta stopped. Real normal for a while.

Then the depression came back, lost my job, gaining weight, ect. and I went to my doctor to talk about it and of course all this came up, which lead to my diagnosis as BPII. Sure, I thing my experience was a bit out of the ordinary but it just doesn't sound like what you guys talk about when you talk about mania.",Bipolar

12634,"There are a number of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) techniques that I have found helpful for myself including Spielmans 3-P model, which helps explain depression and anxiety. It says that there are 3 main factors that come together to create a chronic illness (like depression or anxiety disorders). The first is predisposing factors. Predisposing factors are things like genetics or cultural/family attitudes and they are generally out of our control. Predisposing factors increase our chance of developing the symptoms of a chronic issue (if the other two factors are also present). The next is precipitating factors (or triggers) which lead to the manifestation of the symptoms (in your case maybe the panic attack at 13). Precipitating factors are usually traumatic experiences. In order for the illness to become chronic, there generally needs to be perpetuating factors as well. Perpetuating factors are thoughts or behaviors which often initially arose to help you cope with the symptoms, but now are causing the issue to continue. Behavioral activation is a specific type of CBT for depression that helps you identify what your perpetuating behaviors may be and take concrete steps to stop engaging in those behaviors. An example of one of my own perpetuating factors for depression was isolating myself/not leaving the house. In many cases this urge to isolate arose out of mental fatigue or to avoid anxiety provoking situations. But in the long run, too much isolation worsened my depression because I ended up cutting myself off from the people, activities, and outside information (outside of my own brain) that helped me regulate my emotions and feel more pleasure/joy. Changing a perpetuating behavior once you have identified it takes patience and coping skills. Coping skills help you cope with the uncomfortable emotions that come up in a way that does not perpetuate the problem. It was hard for me to get myself to do the therapy (especially in the beginning) but I can tell it has really rewired my brain in a way that makes life feel more pleasant. I am sorry about your suffering and I hope you find a way to feel better soon. CBT principles that I have found helpful",Depression

35843,"Can’t stop worrying about severe illness, cancer, surgery, and anesthesia failure - think I’m going to jinx it happening by stopping worrying about it. This is pretty superstitious, but basically it’s the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them, so I’m afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening.  

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, it’s going to be more of a letdown.  This already happened this year.  I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.

So for my birthday we went over and spent the night at my dads. (Me being me and my mom, they were and are better friends than lovers) Long story short, I watched my dad violently beat my moms ass, like this was probably the worst fight I have ever seen. Biting, slamming, all that. My mom up and ran out of that house and I did not see her for a little while. Well she ended up going to the streets, and turning to meth to cope. And its been about 10-11 years since then. I failed middle and high school because I just could not do it. Which I have a lot of regret about. Because I am smarter than 85% of the kids who did. But whatever, Ill get my GED. CPS has been involved with all my siblings except for me. My grandma was able to foster/adopt my autistic little brother thankfully. But I still have not heard from/about/or how my little sister is doing. Its probably coming up on 2 years since I have seen her last, and I am starting to doubt I ever will again.

I've changed myself, tried to work on who I was, made myself more likable, went to the gym, and started taking care of myself. I've been to 9 different doctors, for different opinions. 7 therapists just to find one I was comfortable with. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FUCKING MEDICATION. I've tried Zoloft, Abilify, Lamictal, Zyprexa, Lexapro, Strattera, Prozac, Seroquel, Risperdal, Xanax, Klonopin, and Ativan. Not to even mention the ""natural"" supplements I tried out of pure desperation. IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.

The only combination that ""worked"" for me was the olanzapine/fluoxetine combo with Lamictal as a mood stabilizer. That combination bought me a month of euthymia, A FUCKING MONTH before it started to go to shit again. My mood started to decline for NO FUCKING REASON. My life was going perfectly, BUT FOR SOME FUCKING REASON MY MOOD STARTED TO DECLINE. I decided to go off Lamictal because of the brain fog, and because it wasn't helping at that point. Eventually, I went off of olanzapine because of the fatigue. Replaced it with quetiapine but that didn't do shit. Got hospitalized because my depression was getting out of control, I went out with hope for the first time. I got discharged on January 28th, wasn't really doing well but I was hopeful, by February 8th all that hope AND MORE was crushed. Attempted suicide, and spent another 3 days at the hospital but refused to get admitted to the ward again because they were completely fucking useless.

Just completely over, no way it was ever getting better after that. Went back to olanzapine and here I am.

As I said, my life is over. This illness has defeated me. It's been a month and it hasn't gotten any bit better.

I am not sure the best way to go about this so I am just going to list the reasons why I think I might be bipolar (based on symptoms that I have found out by googling).1. The best way to describe myself and my mental state at any time is that I have two halves of me - the ""good"" half, and the ""bad"" half. When I am in my ""good"" half, I cannot imagine what it is like to be in the ""bad"" half, and vice versa.2. The switches between these two halves can be very sudden. Last week, I felt suicidal and the most depressed I would felt in a very long time. I self harmed 7 times in one day. My therapist asked me if I had been able to process the emotions I was feeling last week and I literally could not even imagine them. I feel optimistic about the future, I feel more energised, I actually enjoy doing my hobbies. I always thought this was normal for depression...3. Whenever I have good days with my depression, they are ALWAYS followed by even worse days. It got to the point that I actually hate feeling happy because I know that I am going to feel even worse after it, and it does not seem worth it. During those happy days, I am sociable, I chat to people a lot, I enjoy going about my life and being busy. I feel confident that I am good at my work, I know why I was given this position. During the depressed days after, I struggle to even get out of bed, I cancel hanging out with people, I sit and scroll on my phone, cannot be bothered to do anything (I am addicted to caffeine and I cannot even make myself go and get coffee - I will just let the withdrawal symptoms happen), I wear my comfort clothes (like my blanket jumper and pjs).4. My mood can switch in an instance. The other day, I was having a breakdown, hated myself, could not get up and I could not stop crying. Literally a minute later, I stopped crying, felt happy and able to be productive. Got up, went and made myself a drink, tidied the house, did the dishes...5. I often fluctuate with how much I want to see other people - there are times I love hanging out with friends, meeting new people, hanging out with colleagues... others, I just want to stay home with my husband and dog, close the curtains and shut out the world.6. I often flip from feeling happy and content to insanely frustrated for incredibly minor reasons where my whole body feels ridiculously tense and I snap at people a lot, then get really confused why I am so irritable - normally happens after a good day where I have felt fairly ""normal"" and happy.7. Speaking of normal, this is something I do not really understand. I do not ever have ""normal"" periods, my ""normal"" is that I do not feel anything, I struggle to do work and my seemingly stable mental state is very precarious, it takes very little to knock it back to depressed again.I feel like this makes no sense, but I am hoping that someone can read it and understand. I am currently taking an antidepressant (sertraline) and it does not seem like it is doing anything for me. I have tried other antidepressants but none that work.Please someone help... do not know if I am bipolar or just depressed",Depression

20436,"I am curious if other people are the same as me, or if I am just mentally insane. I will start. I am suicidal. So what do I want? It is pretty obvious. I WANT to fucking die. The truth is, I do not want you telling me not to get what I want. I do not want to hear you telling me ""Things will get better."", because you do not know that. I do not want to hear you deny the bad things I said about myself and list out what YOU think are good things about me, because you really do not know a damn thing about me. All I want to hear from you is that you heard me, and that it is OKAY for me to die. Alright, maybe the second part is a bit tough. I am pretty sure it is against the rule, and nobody is going to be crazy enough to say that to a suicidal person. It certainly not going to help them get better. However, that is honestly how I feel. I just want someone to tell me it is okay for me to escape this hellhole, instead of continuing to endure this suffering. I just cannot do it anymore.Now, what about you all? I want to know what you want to hear from people. Maybe, this will help lessen those generic anti-suicide responds. I know people are tired of hearing it, myself included. I also would like to thank people who try to help others. I know it is tough, since you do not know what the right things to say. Sometime, there is just no right things to say. And that is okay. I feel that Just acknowledging that I exist is enough for me. No need for an encouraging respond or whatever. Suicidal people, what do YOU want to hear from people?",Depression

I see a physio, a TMD specialist, a psychiatrist, a therapist, I’ve tried somatic experiencing therapy, emdr, tre - I’m exhausted honestly. I journal, I read, I meditate, I cry, I dance, I walk, I get out in nature - all things I do naturally, not forced but that should help.

I’ve started a new job about 2 weeks ago, it’s a higher paying customer care job for an insurance company. I was in retail for 5 years and incredibly comfortable in my position. It’s a work from home role, I needed something different as retail was driving me up the wall, and I can put on a damn good customer service facade. 

Anyway, today I’ve been taking calls and all of a sudden, became overwhelmed with everything and burst into tears. I cried during a call, and could not stop crying until I logged out. I’ve spent the entire evening on the phone to my parents crying and crying to my partner. I’m dreading doing it again. I was ready to quit.

14540,"Hi, redditors. First time posting. Dunno where else to put this.Little background: I am a fit, healthy (mostly) M23 with a history of chronic and sometimes severe depression and frequent (daily) suicidal thoughts with a couple minor attempts some years ago... I am not on any meds but am contemplating taking them lately.My story of my sad summer (so far)This year started off pretty good, finally moved out for the first time last year and have been fairly happy. Have had no luck with the girls I like, even though I am apparently quite handsome. They just lose interest after a while and I have sort of given up on asking any out. Have moved into an apt. more recently with a longtime best friend from HS, which has been decent enough but we are drifting apart because of typical roommate shit. I have accepted it and I am okay with it, I think I would be fine without them in my life after this year. I do not have many friends otherwise though, and the new people I meet are mostly temporary friends. COVID restrictions in my city have also made it tough, particularly because I have not seen most of my extended family in over a year.Other than that I was having my hours gouged at work for a job and company I already hated, they cut me down to 12ish hours a week before I had enough. I would had a few thousand dollars saved so decided to quit. it is been fine since then, but money does not last forever and I do not have enough to support me for long. it is been a month with a little labor work on the side and I am nearly broke again. I was partying too much this summer in general so that does not help my money problem, going to the beach and drinking almost every day... doing coke all night with all kinds of people. From strippers to eccentric youths I have met at said beach. Gradually I began to feel I had a problem, tried to cut back and failed, every time I drink I just lose all inhibition. Finally quit for maybe a couple weeks and stayed sober, was tough but I am alive. Looking for a new job still, maybe not looking as hard as I should, then I get some bad news about my cousin, that is also my age and in the same city, who was partying (like me) and OD'd on drugs I have done before and nearly (or maybe lowkey did) OD'd on too... He was braindead and in hospital for a few days. Then another friend from HS few days later same thing. They died one day and the next. That was a week and a half ago, I broke my sober streak pretty fast. I never tell my parents this kind of shit and it hurts talking about my cousin and friend even more, especially when they say some dumb shit like how they were stupid for what they did etc... I have lost 3 friends my age to drug overdoses this year now and I think it is all just hitting me at once like the cars of a trainwreck smashing into one another and unable to stop.On the upside my best friend's birthday was this last week, though I almost did not want to go but convinced myself to so I could have a good time, and while on a raging bender I went with them and friends to another city to party. I think I drank almost constantly from breakfast to bed for at least 5 days straight and hardly ate a meal a day... It was a good experience all things considered, I made a lot of good memories in Montreal... that entire day and night of my friend's bday in particular was like an indie film... but I do not know if I have ever gone that hard in my life and it scares me in hindsight. I was doing a few different drugs with those friends on the birthday as well, literally all day, and disappeared with half of the drugs to go bar hopping when they did not want to go out of the air BnB we were staying in. They were not happy, and I did not have a working phone for them to call me on... or any of their phone numbers.That night was great but the day after... that hangover was the scariest I have ever had, and the day before we would all left to Mtl I broke my phone after getting home with a stockpile of booze so could not call anyone. I was pretty sure I would suffer a heart attack if I got up off my couch and decidedly stayed put for the entire first day and night I was back. My heart was POUNDING from the withdrawals as I would probably taken enough alcohol and coke / molly for three people. I think part of me wanted to die, though I do not think I would have as I am a fit 23 year old male but... I was pretty sure I would be the next of my friends to overdose that day. I like to think this has been transformative, but I am still drinking and I think I have a long way to go to get out of this rut I have dug myself into... but I have been here before. I tell myself I will not commit suicide, even if it feels like it would solve all my problems and set me free, because I do not want to hurt my family and friends. I feel I owe them all my life, hopefully a good life. I still think of jumping from my balcony every day though.Going to see my cousin's grave tomorrow and say goodbye finally. Lots of family will be there and I will be sober. it is going to be thunder showers all day so I got an umbrella. I think it is fitting. Maybe the hard rain will wash the tears from my face and the stains from my soul. I have been crying more these past weeks than I have through my entire adult life and I am ready for it to stop. I am not religious either, I still consider myself an atheist (not so sure lately) but I have prayed to ""god"" and asked to let me bear the burden of my family's grief so theirs might be lessened. Among other things. So I think this pain will never go away and I will just try to be strong for them and myself instead. I am not sure what I want from this post except to write about it and get it off my chest. it is been keeping me up tonight. Maybe I will start writing poetry again.So thank you for reading, if you did. I hope all of you out there stay well, there is beauty and meaning out there if you look for it. I have been finding much of it lately, just do not expect it to fall into your lap. Go out and find it. there is all kinds of wonderful things out there just waiting for someone to stand witness.

49608,"At this point in life I rarely truly worry about the swings and cycles, but my brain has been so unstable lately that I'm am worried. It's been a very rough past couple years and so many things have been affected by what's happened. To be clear I am not suicidal in any capacity. My cat would never forgive me and I do enjoy being alive even when it's chaotic and kinda terrible.

I have basically been rapid cycling the past 11 months with a few intermittent bigger episodes, dealing with a very fresh PTSD development due to being in an abusive relationship with someone who in a psychotic rage beat a woman so bad he caved in part of her skull. He's in prison now but it doesn't erase the damage done to her or me.

I had 6 months med access instability, 1.5 years of job instability, housing environment instability, other health problems (ever tried to use your hands when you can't feel 80+ percent of them?) and these god damn hallucinations and crying spells really need to fking stop.

I've been trying out more meds, different med combos, self-care, coping mechanisms. I've been in therapy and physical therapy and those are helping. I keep my appointments with my specialists and p-doc. I do my job the best I can and try to keep my shit together but I've been barely holding my head above water for such a long time with it all and I feel like I'm about to drown.

No, correction. I feel like I'm drowning. I've been drowning for a  while and I just realized it.

I'm just trying to survive and it's getting harder and harder to do so. I'm bawling just typing this out.

I did my taxes today and for the first time in the 13 years of paying taxes I authorized someone else to talk to the irs if necessary.  I wrote down my important login information. I've been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything. I know my sister will take care of my cat if I can't, I've already gone over all of Annie's overall care and needs especially regarding her medical care and environmental needs.

I need a fresh start. There are too many ghosts in this area that haunt me and my dreams. I've had too much loss and trauma to call it home anymore. I want to move up north to the only place I can call home. I want to move into my dad's place and live with one of the few humans I trust.

I brought it up today and he's thinking about it. I will see what his thoughts are about it later.

I can't stand how things are anymore and I need to be better.

In addition to my lithium, lamictal, vyvanse, buspirone, propranolol and gabapentin, I started vraylar last week but it's not working fast enough so I start olanzapine tomorrow. Maybe it will help me. I'm really hoping it will help me because I can't hold it together anymore, not even for my cat.

I hate and despise my brain with the fury of a thousand bonfires. I wish I could be normal. I wish I was blissfully unaware of how any of this feels.

I spent most of my 20's learning how to handle bp and to become and stay stable. But apparently my early 30's are having a laugh at what I managed to achieve.

Edit: my dad said yes. I'll be moving mid-may after a few appointments and finalizing everything.

I'm going to be paying cash for my meds for a little while until I can get on Medicaid, but that's okay. I'm hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me (up to 5 days before the days supply ends) so I can build up extra. Maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end. I'm gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money. I gotta get Annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital. And ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so there's more of a buffer zone for her (because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time).

I have so much to do! I have more hope again. God damn I love my dad. He's always been beyond awesome and supportive, he has been one of my biggest supporters in multiple ways over the years. I legitimately don't know if I would be here typing this if he wasn't who he is.

I had some happy tears today and I'm like to think they outweighed all the sad and angry ones that I've had lately.

Edit 2: honestly this post doesn't even mention many of the other things, like the rage I have felt for sometime, a brief hope and desire to date someone. A miscarriage I still mourn and how I never told him that I named her. The depth of complexity and severity of my nerve, skin and gut problems and how much money has been spent on them. Or how I stopped loving my job because I hate the place I work and my coworkers are a pack of wolves who I've tried to hide weaknesses from.

So a few months ago a good friend of mine, after a night of drinking told me had been planning to kill himself on April 8th but wasn't going to anymore. It is clear he was thinking about this when he was in a low state and he was definitely more manic at that point when we were talking. He has been starting to understand his own ebbs and flows.  He texted me the other day after cancelling on me telling me that he was emotionally drained after this past weekend and needed some space. I've made sure he knows I care about him and I am here for him and have tried to be respectful of his space, but also, April 8th is this weekend and I know he is in a depressive state. My only slip up was I messaged him about a possible trip together, but realized that might have been more overwhelming. I want to make sure I see him this weekend. 

It's going to be a rough weekend for me, my great aunt passed away,  so her wake and funeral is this Saturday morning. I was thinking of messaging him:

 ""Hey, I'm sorry to be messaging you so much. 

I'm going to be home this weekend and it's kind of looks to be a rough one. It would be really good to see you. I'll be around Saturday night or Sunday if you could swing it.""

Do you think this will also be overwhelming? Should I just mention I'll be around and not my personal stuff that he might feel like he has to take on? 
I don't want to just show up at his house but I'm not above it. Would love your thoughts on how you would either best approach this or how you'd feel most comfortable in his shoes.

Now shes at home most of her time. Alone. Her loved cat died earlier this year. she says the whole house just feel dead to her and she is so lonley there. But at the same time she doesnt want to be around others. i know that every time i visit her she struggles and is always close to cancel, but knows that she feels a little better afterwards. 
 
she is calling for help -indirectly. i get the calls. she wants back some structure in her days. she wants to help someone by reading books for kids or a women in a wheelchair who is helpless. But she cant bring herself to do it. 
 
I dont want to push her to much. But i also have to strong urge to help her somehow. more than visit her once a week and listen to her. But i dont know how. i cant imagine the situation she is going throuht. i cant relate to that feeling but i want her to get better and be that brave, wise, strong and creative person she was before. she wants help but i dont know how. she cant bring herself and i dont wanna be to pushy.

However, the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldn't sleep on Thursday (they're at their worst when I try to sleep). I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However, I've now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days.

Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough (I us an e-cigarette), as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulder-blade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.

My doctor said everything felt normal, my blood pressure was normal, as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an x-ray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out (tight chest, sweating, vomiting, trouble sleeping, just overall freaking out about what that x-ray might show). Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest, trouble sleeping with bad thoughts, and general feeling of just being uncomfortable.

Also the guide to girl ratio here is out of control. there is got to be at least 10 guys for every woman that is available. Then you factor in everything from the unique primal intrigue that flows through the veins of any human being in this city, and again, it is impossible. Within this gigantic sea of terrible men, there are few Good Men drowning, not even being thrown a life preserver. it is a shame. it is a waste of time, energy, good souls, and the possibility of memorable love. I am tired of fighting through the walls being built by women and forged by pieces of garbage men. I am fed up, and it makes me enormously depressed.I never had a problem dating in this city in the past, but now I cannot get a foot in the door, a word in edgewise and I know it is not me. Even the caliber of personality shared with most women in this city has gotten more judgmental and aggressive. Most of the women that are younger, they want money. They want a sugar daddy without realizing that we just came through a pandemic where most people are not as flush with cash anymore due to inflation.Then you have a lot of left-leaning liberal women who will not even talk to a person who is a centrist. Since when did politics have to play a huge role in dating? In the worst of it is, the vaccine. If you did not get a vaccine, you are basically a piece of shit to everyone who did. And I thought there was a law in place that protected your personal medical privacy. What do I know.What I do know is all of it makes me so depressed and feel so lonely. I am a good guy, dedicated, intelligent, talented. Every single night after the sun sets, reality sets into how lonely I really feel. And there is this dark hope inside of me saying there is somebody out there but I really do not think so.We dug our own holes here. we have become so selective, so judgmental, some materialistic, so single-minded, our eyes are not open, and we push people away. we would rather be alone because we are afraid to catch a virus. we would rather be alone because we do not want to deal with the possibility of somebody losing their job and becoming dependent on the other. we would rather be alone because it is easier to lump everybody into a category that supports a divide that is country wide.Where I agree with most of that, and I am an introvert, so I understand being alone, but damn do I want to hold somebody is hand. the state of dating...",Depression

17579,"I am writing this while drinking a bottle of wine while crying and as the title says, i think I have instantly hit rock bottom, i thought i could not get any lower, when you try to come out about my depression here i am. I am planning on killing myself soon but i just felt i needed to put this.I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts, the notion of wanting to not have been born feels natural. I think it started when i was 4 and getting beat and locked up in a storeroom at home and getting bullied in school.One of my first memories was of my older sister getting dragged to the storeroom to be locked up while I stood there crying, thinking back, this might have been the first time i disassociated from reality i still remember how it felt like i had no control over my body just watching the movie play out. I try to pretend like those two years do not bother me but it does. I can still clearly see flashes of those 2 years and i hate it.There were about 3 points in my life where i resolved to kill myself: When i was 5, where a kid who was bullying me bit me on the face for using the toilet before he did and i was blamed by the school for starting the fight, i remember that was the first time i seriously thought of ending it, nobody would believe me because his friend said i started it. This was the first time you locked me in my room and looked out the window of my apartment and thought long about jumping. Eventually, i pussied out and i blanked out for a long time after that, i cannot even remember what happened after that it felt like memory only resumed after i saw my abuser get punished at 6 years old.The second time i resolved to unexist was when i was put into a school far away from my home, i knew no one there and as a person who is bad at talking i naturally got bullied, my already shitty health got worst, i had terrible stomach pains particularly in the morning, i was afraid to leave my home. My books were glued, table vandalized, i felt the whole class was against me. Then one day when a guy was pouring water on my table I snapped, i think i had my first anxiety attack, i pulled his arm hard thinking of smashing his face in, but then I instantly started crying, i felt intense fear, my heart was beating out of whack I felt like everyone was laughing at me, i could not breathe, my stomach churning, and my mind went blank. My teacher talked to me after class but at that point, I have fully disassociated I do not think i heard anything i just went ok for everything. I started skipping more classes feeling like my room was the only safe place, i fell asleep almost every night crying about how big a disappointment i was to my parents, how useless i am, i have no talenfs, i was only a burden on everyone, the only thing i deserved was to die. i was planning to do so but once again i pussied out my useless urge to live won out, because a man on youtube saved my life, he was a comedian from sourcefed at that time, his name was Steve Zaragoza when i was 13 he was pretty much what was keeping me alive with sourcefed table talks, and what he said i think pretty much saved my life, he said the stopped getting bullied because he became the funny kid. So i became the funny kid, i started craving attention, everyone liked me, i was the goofy fucker, one of the class clowns, but that was only temporary.The urge to end it lessened and i soon started going to the gym.I was getting better. I was at 105Kg (about 200lbs) back then and through out 2 years i lost about 30Kg ( about 65lbs). I thought that at that point i would feel happier and more confident i would become OK, but it did not the thoughts at the back of my head still remained. i went off the diet and i gained back all the weight by the time 6 monthes passed, every though i ate normally, this shit just made me give up hope losing weight.The third time in the past i tried to end it was when i was in 2018 (at about 17 and 18 years old) , i went into the school i wanted; the school and course my parents wanted i thought i was happy my sense of self worth was at its peak and i thought i had made my whole family proud being the topp 10%, but of course again i was wrong i could not handle the pressure of my course, i coundn't wrap my head around the subjects taught and from that pressure i decidedd to run away i skipped my, classes, my exams, dropped ou, planned to work for a while go on holiday and then end it after the holiday settleing some loose ends. I Planned to die, did not decide the method this time but it was what i felt was rock bottom. I never tried to tell anyone besides as disgusing it as a joke to friends, never said anything to to family, or to any doctors i just kept it to myself, because i thought no one deserves to be burdened by my shit and i was embarrassed and scaredBut i think the reason i did not kill myself was my niece, i watched over her often as my sister was working and her father was a piece of fucking shit. I felt like i was her father i felt like i had to be there for her, i did not want her to have a shitty shildhood, i wanted her to grown up healthy and sane.Turns out i was ok with working i enjoyed my time talking to customers, the pay was enough, for me, and i felt like my life was amounting to something i felt sort ok and then covid came knocking and the lock down began. The lockdown brough my family closer, i soon had a nephew too and felt responsible for him soon after. I wanted to be there for them. I want them to be fuckin normal people unlike me me. I wad happy for a whiel.Now brings us to current times, lockdown is over, i was conscripted into the military like every other man in our ountry. I went through my 1 month basic trainig thinking, i would get a job that would let me go home everyday like a 9 to 5, but i did not, i had to stay in a military camp from sunday night to friday, i cannot see my familt, the thoughts were getting more and more frequent and i after just a few weeks of staying here the feeling of it feels stronger and stronger, but i could not just leave my friend to handle everything, so i endured for a while.Yesterday at the military doctors office i just blurted out my anxious feelings and some outher shit that i could not put into words properly and he asks me to come back later but with my superiors and 2 other random guys in the office, i choked while they accused me of lying and lectured me about growing up and just deal with it while i was too nervous, i could not form a sentence, through the doctor saying why i did not highlight the issue to previous doctors, it did not make sense for me to say it now. I fully disassociated. I did not cry i just agreed with what they said like it was the truth, i had once again truly decidded to kill myself after 3 years.The first time i try to tell anyone about my issue did not belive me and instead put me through a interrogation, discredited and berated me the entire time. I have hit even lower than what i thought was possible.There is no hope, there is no meaning, i should not exist. My life has ni value. My wine is done and my drugs are in me hopefully this is my last day. Also sorry about the errors and long post. Good afternoon good evening and goodnight. Instantly pushed to rock bottom",Suicidal

I've just sent off an email for a volunteering work, it's a simple museum carer, I will take care of the gardens, the tourists and whatever needs available.

It's all flexible hours, I won't get into any trouble if I miss a few days or whatnot.

But I am still. So. Fucking. Scared.

This isn't anything, ""O new situation fear"" no I've been to the museum once or twice and know the people, I know the community. 

But I am so damn fucking scared of rejection. I am scared of the possible outcomes this will bring me. I am scared of the social aspects of it.
I keep getting these thoughts of, ""they'll think I'm a creep"" ""I'll probably never keep up with it because I am a pathetic good for nothing, lower to everyone else"".
It's hurting me. 

And I need advice on how to just keep going, what should I do once it starts? Fight through the thoughts and fears?

It was already hard enough as it was to do the paper, now I'm crashing wondering ""What the fuck was I thinking!?"" 

But I'm trying to keep positive as much as I possibly can. This could be a mix of social anxiety and AVPD running it's course but I don't know, all I know is that I am scared and very fearful of the future, of people, of being seeing in public, of messing up big time.

46149,"(xpost from /r/bipolar)Weird experience with latuda monotherapy? Advice? Throwaway account cause i don't really use reddit, i just needed some advice

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and started taking latuda about 20 days ago. The initial 20mg dosage gradually killed my (at the time) current hypomanic episode within a week, which was fantastic! I also noticed some, but not all, depressive feelings being held at bay, which was nice, if not quite optimal.

However, I bumped up to 30mg about a week ago, and 2 days after that, I had a psychotic episode until the next morning-I felt incredibly debilitating dissociative symptoms and I felt like my body was acting seperately from my mind in a way that was trying to kill me. I couldnt really talk, and mentally, I felt completely void and couldnt form a coherent thought. (my experience was a lot like that of this blog post: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-mom/2012/03/i-had-a-medication-induced-psychotic-episode/). Since I have bp2, mania with that much cognitive and physical impairment isn't really normal for me.

Anyways, after that experience my psychiatrist recommended that I cut back to 20mg latuda (which seemed to help with hypomania to some degree) until the end of the college semester, and we planned to experiment with med cocktails after the summer. With all this in mind, I'd like to have some sort of plan going forward. Is there a safe way I can continue to ramp up my latuda dose (i.e. in conjunction with a stronger antimanic agent like lithium)? Or should I quit latuda and try a different drug entirely?",Bipolar

46364,"Weird hypomania, or am I just an idiot? Ever since my diagnosis 2 years ago I've gotten pretty good at recognizing my hypo/manic symptoms...after the fact at least, but more than a few times I've had experiences where I just have one, maybe two symptoms for a week or two, then one or two days that might actually qualify as something.  

Uniformly it's pleasurable/risky behavior/ being more goal oriented. I have pretty high self esteem all the time unless I'm depressive so I can't use it to judge (unless it's gotten to the point where I think about running for office or starting a cult, that's pretty obvious)

I don't get flight of ideas, sleeplessness, distracted, pressured speech, etc during these times. When I'm full blown hypo/manic I get at least 50% of the above.

Its so confined, people are screaming (some screaming about how they want to leave), the food was garbage, there were no group activities to learn how to cope and get better. It felt like I just checked into a prison. The outside area is all locked up and super small. It felt absolutely suffocating. I am pissed because I thought I would be helped on how I can cope with these thoughts, what to do, etc. Instead, the nurses just medicate the hell of you when you tell them you are anxious (because you are locked up and all you can do to pass the time is wander the halls). And you see the psychiatrist maybe once a day, sometimes every other day for literally under 15 minutes. What a goddamn joke. I will never, ever check myself into a hospital ever again.

Over the last 10 years or so, I have been slowly and methodically pushing everyone out of my life, family and friends, and have not even been fully conscious that I was doing so until recently in the last several years, when it was much too late and everyone had already gone. It really sunk in when my last best friend disappeared on me, and I spent forever thinking what a shitty person he is and passing the flaws off onto him. But in hindsight, he was the smartest friend I ever had for taking the initiative on his own. there is only one person left in my life physically, and I hate myself more and more each day that I have not relieved her of the burden that is me. Her exact words recently have reinforced my feelings here, and which help me understand that the problem is within me, and it is me.

I have been diagnosed with depression and bipolar and am pretty familiar with when to know a manic episode is coming but my depression just hits me low.All my colleagues always call me floaty because I am happy and chill by nature. I never fight and always ignore drama and conflict. Here I get to the point:My family was recently attacked by a neighbor and my dad defended us by stabbing him so he went to jail for bail. In that time my mom and I were alone and living peacefully without problems or drama but my dad was suffering in jail and we kept on working to fairly get him out so he was the victim. I was really worried about my dad coming home because he is always been very negative and makes anything a problem. He came back a nice, modest man who is grateful for everything.

My dad went crazy accusing her of theft and screaming at us even though I got the phone back immediately. I had a panic attack due to all the screaming and anger.Today nobody in the house is talking, everything is tense.I am just depressed and disappointed.

I just wanted to say for all the times I kept mute when you spoke to me, for all the times it seems I get mad at simple questions you asked that I should just give a straight answer but instead it seems like I am mad at you for asking. For all the times I make you think is he going to get mad at this before you ask me your loving motherly questions, I AM SORRY. I am truly sorry. I know it keeps happening even though I wish it does not. I wish I could talk to you like a loving son would talk to his loving mother. I wish I could answer your loving question which are questions you ask to ensure I get the best out of everything. I wish everything can be normal but it is not. I am not normal. My brain is fucked. Depression has eaten the shit out of me. It feels like I have lost the ability to take any joy in life. The reason why it seems as though I am mad is because I am so fucked everything triggers me. You ask about my school; there was once a time the word school triggers me. When you ask, I wish I could tell you but instead I fall into depression. You talk about my sisters, I have a panic attack. My uncle or sisters calls your number I have a panic attack. I wish I could just experience peace. I have been abused for all my childhood and most of my teens. I still suffer from these. I have vivid nightmares and flashbacks. You have seen me wake up crying a couple of times. Sometimes when we share the bed, I kick you in the middle of my sleep. I am sorry for this too. Its my nightmares. I am been tortured in my dreams. My abuse are fresh in my memories that my dreams are as though its happening again. I wish I could explain to you all and you would understand. I do not just chose to be in bed all day, moody, sad, and listen to sad song. I do not choose to be this way nor do I like the way I am. For all the times I was called lazy, I was not lazy. I was dieing a death that eats you up slowly. For all he questions you ask which have triggered me every single time. For the once you asked today that fell on deaf ears followed by a long silence or an odd answer, For all the ones you will ask tomorrow and the next, I wish I could answer them all. I am sorry you have to feel this way. Trying your best not to hurt me, trying your best to see me happy. But all I do is let my depression eat me away like a vulture feeding on its carcass. I wish I could be genuinely happy but at this point, all I want to do is rest. I want to experience peace. The kind of peace I do not have to worry about any single thing. The kind of peace you do not have to worry about me. The kind of peace where I cease to exist. Yeah I have big dreams, but it would not matter when I rest. I tried to kill myself unsuccessfully and I am afraid it might happen again this time successfully but why do I fear? This is what I have wanted when I spent years practicing with the knife, when I swallowed the pills and watch you watch me in pain as I puke my gut out, when I started learning to tie a noose, when I did lots of reasearch on the most painless way to go. Though there are things you do that hurts. Like you saying I did things I did not do or using my name to get money from family members. I have said it several times to you that I wish I was never born. I told you once out of frustration that you should kill me. That I did not ask to be born. I have never told you, but despite my life full of abuse, deep down you are my mom and I do love you just as a child loves its mother. Sometimes I have this feeling inside that I just have a few more years before I finally end my life in college studying the course you all want me to study When I actually want something else. I guess that is it. I have nothing else to say than what you have heard me say before; I wish I was not born. To my mom,",Suicidal

Was able to use work to distract me from thoughts but last December I had a work place injury that caused me to have seizures and chronic migraines. Had to move back in with my dad and nephew because I coupdnt drive to get groceries or make appointments. For 6 months workers comp kept postponing a neurological visit while I watched the medical bill pile climb. Finally saw a Dr who was 2 hrs 30min away and after 2 visits lasting 15 min each, he said it was stress related. Workers comp dropped me like a sack of potatoes and said good luck. 1 month later and still having episodes without any sign of a trigger. Memory is getting worse, was not able to remember nephews name and after dad got back from a week long trip I did not recognize his face. Tried getting CBT but cannot afford it. Going to online school to keep mind occupied but will fall asleep for 24-36 hrs after a 6hr course day. Tried using free therapy but cops showed up to house to take me to ER after telling Dr over phone that idealizition was getting to point I was having visions of doing it and waking up confused when I was still at my computer desk. Overheard nephew telling people all I do is sleep and that he does not like that I lived with him. Dad stopped having genuine conversations with me after talking to the cops. Last thing he said was I should not put him through lossing a son. Now when I talk to him it seems like he is annoyed or wants me to figure out how to be happy. Other family members or friends have told me to get over it after telling them what the Dr told me. I have tried telling myself that I am having the seizures on purpose for attention and that I have tricked myself into believing they are real. When I end up sleeping for entire day or two, I have been telling myself its because I am a leech wanting people to feel bad for me. I want to go back to work but I am super nervous about trying to explain that I have stress induced seizures that because me to have partial awareness and that sometimes my feet and, hands turn blue for no reason.

For a little background, I grew up in a household where my mother and I weren't on the best terms and all she did as I grew up was work occasionally and sleep in bed all day long. Microwave dinners were a regular thing for me and my brothers, I did pretty bad in school blah blah blah. The big thing was, I was never taught good hygiene as a kid. It was never required or encouraged enforced. I grew up and went through high school without showering regularly, doing assignments, or even engaging with many people outside of school because my mom didn't allow me to get out of the house much. I'd spend my time, playing games, reading, and a loooot of media. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a weird smelly kid in highschool (surprisingly with the whole shower thing. I didn't sweat or anything and always used deodorant and perfume clean clothes etc.) I had a lot of friends that I talked to daily up until senior year. My senior year was when Covid hit and everyone was in quarantine. When school started back up I never went because it was online. That same year I moved in with a new bf and his dad and uncle and since I was so accustomed to staying in a room all day without socializing or doing anything, that's what I did there. I dropped out of highschool and lived with my new boyfriend at the time for two years and to this I realized that I still never leave the room I stay in. Even when my bf has a job that requires him to travel for work, I stay in the hotel room still having horrible hygiene habits (although again not smelling bad or anything) and consuming lots of media from the bed. I'd have moments where come to the realization that l've spent days, weeks, then months doing the exact same thing and wasting the entire day away doing absolutely nothing. It's only dawned on me now that something could be wrong and I should hear other's opinions on it. Of course I'm using a throw away because sharing this is embarrassing enough. I've never considered myself depressed and honestly I never want to but every time Hook up what l'm dealing with su*cide and help websites pop up...

I don't know how to go about this and I genuinely want to do better, so if anyone knows some steps I can take to doing better, I'd really appreciate it.

46750,"Advice, Bear with Me PLS Hi everyone. I have never posted on Reddit, this is my first time and I wish it were something good, but I need help and am too afraid to turn to anyone right now. This is TMI, but its the internet right? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been struggling to figure out whether or not I have BP, but my complicated past makes me afraid that I may have BPD so I am just going to lay it out and if anyone out there, help me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

To start. There is a stigma surrounding BPD and a part of me admits to being afraid of lying to myself so I don't get labeled as a crazy BPD. My mother was BPD, and my father was a psychologist who diagnosed me as BPD by the time I was twelve, but he also intensely hated my mother. I have always been incredibly emotionally sensitive, but cognitively I was one of those kids who were three levels above everyone in class, and three levels behind on the social scale. I dread seeing a therapist after being raised by my father who became obsessive and emotionally abusive over my being BDP. But bear with me pls.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've had three episodes. My earliest one was when I was thirteen. I remember being overcome with such intense suffering that I collapsed in the shower. It was like I was catatonic. I literally couldn't get up. That night it was as if the world were silent. I remember laying in bed staring at my hands. They kept moving, but I wasn't understanding that I was inside of them. I remember having the intense realization that I was going to watch these hands age, and that I was inside of a living corpse. I was repulsed by that thought and became fascinated with hands for awhile. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second episode happened my first year of college. I'll skip the fluff. One day I just stood up mid class and left. Just dropped out of college. I remember sitting there thinking, what am I doing here? My professor was talking, but I wasn't understanding her words. (I went back to college after a period).

&amp;#x200B;

But what prompted this post was the most recent episode that scared me. I convinced myself that I was losing my mind. I got obsessive over ""sanely questioning my sanity"" and ""being made to make my suffering."" Like my brain just stalled. I was in the middle of a 20 page research paper and I couldn't get my thoughts together to write it. I reread the things I wrote later and realized that I kept repeating the same words over and over. But I was also under an insane amount of stress. I was also convinced that my teachers were correcting my borderline behavior through subliminal therapy (still kind of convinced...?) This ""episode"" lasted for 4 months, but I had decided to quit smoking weed right around the same time. Still, I had been off of weed for awhile when I think I had an audial hallucination. I was on the verge of falling asleep, in that between stage where you're still conscious but your dreams start to engulf you, when this voice in the back of me head detached itself. It took on a presence of its own (idk how to explain) like it floated out of my brain and was talking. It startled me awake. I snapped out of it, but I was really scared for awhile. 

&amp;#x200B;

I won't lie, a part of my has come to terms with being BPD. I have self mutilated, and I have felt suicidal. I get feeling so intense that I don't know how to relieve my emotions so I will drink and push my limits in risky ways. I have issues maintaining relationships (although that has been improving now that I am consciously working on it). I know dual diagnosis is possible, but a part of me seriously worries if I lie to myself so I don't have to face being BPD, living up to the label put on me by an abusive parent. At the same time I am beginning to string together a family history that may suggest psychosis, although no one in my family is open to talking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it to the end, it on me- BPD, BP, BPBPDP. I feel close to myself right now and am looking for answers in my own way. My mental state is getting is affecting my career, and I find myself in a place where people are tiptoeing around me and I can't stand it (but I understand it, and want to start working on fixing it).

50754,"Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD, I don't date much, and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too, but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other, he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. He’s a empathetic person that cares for other people, but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95% sure he's gone to therapy, because even though he will explode at the most random times, there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.

Before we dated, I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly, a few weeks before, he was flirting with me, but I didn’t pick up on it. So when I invited him, it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter (that I don’t follow), he was saying stuff like “playing with people’s feelings is bad” and “disloyal people annoy me”. The next several weeks, he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.

He’ll also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really aren’t a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll. I’m just wondering, if I got into a relationship with him, would it get worse?

I Googled around to learn more, and I came across a bullshit shaming listicle from BP Hope (I thought they were our friends!!!) basically saying “just discipline yourself!”. As if everybody gets the impulse to stay up into the wee hours organizing their bathroom, or the compulsion to spend their whole paycheck on something they didn’t give a shit about a week ago, or the brilliant idea to start their own business with no money, but they’re just better at controlling it. 

At work, it seems to take me twice the time to do things as everyone else, and it’s largely due to constant small, but uncontrollable things I “have to do”.

Where the fuck are my results? I still look like fat shit and I want to fucking die and go away from this world as quickly as possible. I will not be able to pass my next fucking year in this shitty school, cuz I am hecking lazy and I cannot study. Seriously; every single second of my life I find another thing that just pushhes me down into deep ocean of inner madness that will not came out to the outsite world. I would probably try to kill myself, but my fucking talent is stopping me in this. This is more of a curse, than blessing, because everyone are telling me that I have talent in making stories, so I know that if anywhere in the future I would actually do something about it, it could be big. But as I said, I am too fucking lazy to develop anything inside my shitty self. I have bite myself today out of inner anger and I can still see the mark on my hand. Something happened with my ankle 3 days ago, so I was not able to do any workouts, so I am just forced to see how my belly is turning more and more ugle as shit. Summer sucks let me tell, since when it is school, you are at least have something to do, you are busy with something, but now when there is like a LOT of free time, because of my laziness, every single day is constant loop of feelings of wastig time and becaming worse and worse pice of crap that I am. I cannot even find any friends, I have like 1 friend, but I am too fucking shy to talk to anyone. I am fucking alone. And even NOW I know that I am probably doing the worst thing possible, while writing this, because reddit was toxic to me everytime, so now it will probably say something like People have much worse, worse life than You, some do not have family, some are very poor, someone is health is very bad, some life in war and still you are complaining about such little things?! YOU SNOB!!! but I am writing it in such emotional storm, that I do not even care. I WANT TO DIE. I did not even knew where to post this shitty thing I have just wrote and I will probably make another mistake in my life when I post this, but I do not care. Rant for my shitty life",Suicidal

Every time I brush my teeth my gums bleed. I looked closely the other day and saw some plaque buildup and a cavity in a wisdom tooth that grew in sideways. Gross, I know! Its really embarrassing and I am starting to get really anxious about my teeth all falling out so I am making an effort to brush my teeth more often and I got a Groupon to see a dentist for an exam, cleaning, and X-rays. I am seeing them on Thursday. I am wondering how I should communicate to the dentist that I know my teeth are in poor shape due to depression? Is that something they are familiar with? I know I am not obligated to explain myself but I would feel better if I could. And if anyone has suggestions for restoring your teeth after neglect that would also be much appreciated!

I remember wanting to die without knowing why, and tried to hurt myself this young. I still does not who the reason. Time passes and things went darker around me and In my family. I moved far away to escape, but I carried my depression with me since. I started hating the world more and more while working in retail to pay for my studies and my living. I was thinking ""If life is so violent and sad, why I should live it ? Life is useless"" and started thinking too deep about our world, the society we live in and I was making me more sad everytime. I tried everything I had to go back to the surface, but I drowned again last year. I went to hospital because I was letting myself dying more and more. I needed help, I needed someone taking my hand and finally helping me with all my sadness. I needed someone to listen..and I only got bad doctors and medecine, which makes me more and more sick. I am arriving at the point were I just do not know how to live anymore. I cannot count on someone for my health, I feel like I am missing years of my youth because I always had to take care of everything by myself to survive and I feel like people of my age are doing so much more things.

20083,"I doubt I will do it. But I have thought about it for a long time. Someone I cared about took their life almost two years ago, and it put me in a difficult position. I ended up returning home. I think if I had stayed away, I probably would have been dead by now. I believe it honestly would have been easier.I hate myself. I feel like I have been lost and simply existing for the past two years. Feeling sorry for myself. People have offered help in ways that did not actually help me, other than providing me a place to live. Which I am lucky for. But I honestly wish I had taken my chances and found a cheap apartment after my roommate passed, instead of returning home. I hate home. My family is passive aggressive and full of drama. I wish I had attempted to cope on my own. Maybe I would be better off right now.My car eventually broke down. Turns out the make and model was riddled with transmission issues, that I would have known of if I had done more research. Instead of being a desperate dumbass and wanting a mode of transportation despite my bad credit.Then COVID hit. I was and still am living with family who are more at risk if they ever were to get infected. I never would be able to forgive myself if I got them sick. I feel like I should have just stayed away from family and just eventually killed myself. Saved them the pain of becoming reacquainted with me.I have fallen behind on my car payments. I have talked to them and have been trying to find employment, but it is been more difficult than I thought it would be. At this point, with the amount of times they call me each day, I think it is obvious that even if I had taken the right steps and gotten ahold of them before I was unable to pay them back, they would be hounding me just as bad as they are now.I dream about dying. I fantasize about talking to these people on the phone and shooting myself in the head, in the car they financed me. I doubt they would give a fuck, but a shitty part of me wants to hound these agents like they hound me. I want them to feel the anxiety that I feel, with each ring of the phone. And if I am going to lose this shitty broken ass car and have bad credit again for the next 7 years, I am just done. I am fucked up but I want to fuck up a person apart of the system that I fucking despise. Which sickens me. they are just doing their jobs. But I remember how monotone they all sound whenever they speak to me. And I remember this is just how life is. Life is all about money.An even more fucked up part of me feels like I have been self-sabotaging to work myself up to this point. To make it easier to give myself an excuse to exit out of this world. I am scared to talk to anyone about what goes through my head. They have enough to deal with. But there is this shitty dark side of me that wants to go out and leave behind the pain I feel inside everyday. And I fucking hate that part of me. I feel so much resentment for everything and myself.I just wish I had never been born. I think even my family would have been better off without me.I just want my brain to stop. Nearly every day is so painful. I wish I had something to mute the shit inside of my head. I am an anxiety ridden mess.It hurts. I feel pathetic. Like I am a burden to everyone and that they would be better off without me. I know I am a burden. It feels like every time I have tried to climb out of the holes I have dug myself, some shit has happened to put me right back where I started. Like the universe is telling me to end it all.I really just wish I could die in my sleep. I get worked up over the most pathetic shit now and I am just done with myself. I am an emotional mess on the inside over the stupidest things. And yet I hide it. And I feel like most the time I am only pretending to be happy now.

This was a about a month or 2 ago and it feels like now everything has gotten worse. My heart rate is always 100+ and when I’m walking or stand up it’s 140+ sometimes. I was also walking to class upstairs and I was gasping for air and my heart was racing.  The highest my heart I’ve seen my heart go is 195 which doesn’t sound healthy. My heart rate will also go from 50 to 100 randomly which concerns me? Yesterday morning I woke up with my heart rate at 170 so I went to the ER and my ekg was normal. My parents think I’m fine and the doctors say I’m young, it won’t hurt me and I’ll grow out of it. I have anxiety and panic attacks now because I’m always worried about my heart. I feel like i have no answers and like I’m running out of time :( ",Anxiety

15074,"I have depression and anxiety due to series of traumatic events. Sometimes, I am just too exhausted even though I am not doing ""anything"". Just plain on survival mode through the years. I do not want this as an excuse but it is my reality. Struggling to do something. Anxious that I end up doing nothing. That by not performing, I am bad. I am made to feel guilty from grieving. I also had a dysfunctional childhood. I have just lately discovering that it was not a good childhood as I have thought it was. Thr way I was brought up and my childhood experiences paved way to why I am like this in adulthood. I am grieving. My parents does not grasp that their adult child is mentally unwell. Of course, it is my fault. I get all the blame. It hurts when your own mother would label you some deregatory term in our language -- ""dugyot"" means a lazy dirty person. It hurts that they do not understand my struggles. I am trying. I grieve that I will never have the parents that I ""needed"". I was crying silently last night. I was a victim of domestic abuse and they offered me to come move back. I know I need therapy but I do not have the means to pay yet.

11437,"I have set a date for August 4. Simply for the sake of irony, since it is my birthday backwards. I got the helium tank, the plastic tube, the duct tape and the oven bags. Just waiting for the elastic chord that should arrive sometime next week. I have written two letters: one for a friend and one for several other friends. I think I should try to write something to my family, but I do not know what. The only ones in my family I truly love are my dad, my only grandma and one of my aunts. Perhaps one of my grandfathers, but I do not really know him. I do not love my mom, but it would probably break her heart if only my dad got a letter. I just do not have anything to say to her. So perhaps it is better to not write anything at all. My last will and testament is done. I have some laxatives I can take just before, to avoid making a mess. I wish I had some sedatives, but I have read that helium acts quickly. Maybe anxiety will not be that much of an issue.I feel so relieved. So calm. Soon it will all be over. I will not have to deal with being me anymore. Pretty soon I will just be a memory. Later on I will not be anything at all but someone who used to live for a while.

34037,"Irrationally terrified of seizures I have spent today being irrationally terrified of having a seizure. I've never had a seizure before. I've seen my sister having a diabetic seizure, but that's as close as I've gotten to ""experiencing"" one.

My anxiety stems from the fact that people with retinal migraine are at a higher risk of experiencing seizures and strokes.

Then there is this: I was prescribed Wellbutrin last week to help with getting out of bed in the mornings (coupled with venlaflaxine). My psych informed me that drinking alcohol can result in a seizure while on Wellbutrin. In addition, so can combining Wellbutrin and aspirin/Advil. He said Tylenol is OK, and I checked online for any drug interactions, too, which confirmed that it should be OK. I have a cold today and an upset stomach, so I took some Tylenol Cold &amp; Flu pills to relieve it.

And then I spent the rest of my evening preoccupied by the idea of having a seizure because I took Tylenol. I even contemplated seriously telling my boss that I could have a seizure, along with wanting to tell my coworker that if I am on the ground shaking uncontrollably that it is a seizure and to call an ambulance.

Then the Sharpened Rombergs test. 
Stand with your heel to the big toe of the opposite foot (heel to toe) put your hands on your hips and close your eyes. You are supposed to be able to do this for 21-31 seconds. Sometimes I can do like 1.5 minutes, other times I can only do like 15 seconds. 

Then the big one. Standing on one leg with your eyes closed for 15-30 seconds. Stand on your good foot, lift the other foot while bending it, has to be at least 6 inches off the ground. 

I CANT DO IT. I struggle to get to 10 seconds. Sometimes I get 30 but that’s after like 4 tries.

46695,"Anyone else desperately searching for people to bring new ""adventures"" My last hypomanic episode, I met a guy off tinder and we spent pretty much 2 months together everyday. Everyday was a new adventure, lots of alcohol, house parties, clubs, gigs, meeting friends, 4 am walks. So many new environments and experiences, and we pretty much left the house for 14 hours a day and wandered around. And it wasn't all alcohol. Just walking around the streets for hours, talking to new people, watching a new film, going to a new cafe all in a day. Sadly it ended sour. And of course it's not really a healthy way to live. But it felt great to have someone who matched my energy in that state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now coming out of a depressive episode. I don't know what I am right now, but I am longing for someone to sweep me off my feet and have a 7 day bender with me. I'm this close to redownloading tinder and going out with anyone. As awful as it sounds, I don't even really want to hang out with my existing friends like this. I specifically want someone new, and someone who's going to spend an unhealthy amount of time with me and probably kill their liver with alcohol. I don't know, it just seems more exciting? The idea of watching TV with a friend feels like a band aid. I can't be quiet. I want to dance!

11330,"Tomorrow's my last shift at a job that had become nothing but a source of anger, frustration, and toxic energy that turned me into a person I do not want to be anymore. I recently went on a family trip and I was actively angry that I had to go back to working there when I got back. A week later I put in my notice. No regrets on getting out of a situation that made me feel like I was going through the motions, like I was just a character in a video game playing out my script until clocking out, like my input or ideas or suggestions were not listened to or ""I agree with you but (other person) said no"".No regrets, that is, other than leaving when I had nothing else lined up after. Now it feels like the only jobs I will ever be able to get are things that I will end up hating just as much. And the career path I would like to pursue is impractical, untenable, unrealistic, and I should just stop fooling myself into thinking it is possible, so I might as well just accept that I am never going to be happy in what I do for a living.I had been telling myself that I needed to get the 900-pound gorilla off my back before I could move on in a healthy way. Nope, you just could not put up with a standard retail job. Get over yourself, your dreams are pointless, just give up now, and put the customer service voice back on.I would been telling myself ""do not leave a job unless you have another job"". Yeah, and you did not ever look for other jobs while you were working because you were too stressed out and exhausted (or more realistically lazy and like to complain) from your current job that thinking about work became the last thing you wanted to do so you would just wallow in it. And now that you are at the exit ramp, you still have nothing to show for it. Why? Because you are fucking lazy and you need to accept the fact that this is all you are ever going to be. Just give up and get back to work.I would been telling myself ""work yourself out of a job so they will either have to promote you or you go somewhere else and do the next step on that ladder"". Even if they did promote you, that just would have kept you stuck there even longer, or if you went somewhere else you would be still doing the same thing you hate. Which is the only thing you are ever going to get paid to do, anyway, so suck it up and put the tags back on.The only thing I have *ever* truly wanted to do with my life, and I mean across all of my years of existence, is to put on a show, make people laugh, and help them forget about their problems for a while. But I am not a good enough actor/writer/comedian/performer/anything to get paid to do that for anyone else, I know I would never succeed trying to start something on my own, and the wild card option I keep toying with is unrealistic (for many reasons), most notably because I am already probably too old to start and I would be even older by the time I was good enough.So I might as well just accept that all I am ever meant to do is suck it up, accept my fate, and go through the motions of living doing something that will never let me be happy.

I got the diagnosis after a massive manic episode, and in that manic state I actually thought I had finally found joy in life, and an end to my depression for good. A conclusion to my struggles ect ect. 

But that conclusion was ripped apart as I got the diagnosis. My so called happiness was taken away from me. (but being manic was of course very bad for my health since I hardly ever ate and I did reckless shit. You know classic mania 101)

When I started on the meds I kept telling myself that one day I'll be stable and then I will find a new and better conclusion/happiness. But it's been a year and I'm loosing my patience because I simply don't feel better than what I did before my manic episode, before the aggressive depression that lasted a year, even before there even was a build-up to that depression.

(I'm starting to tear up as I write this)

I can't live with my own thoughts. They always focus on the pessimistic side of things. And even in bright times they seem to spiral down into some negative memory that involves either depression or mania. (all my memories of the mania has turned negative because it's now clear to me how much of an asshole I was, and all the bad/irresponsible shit I did that had consequences on behalf of my friends and people I knew). And these spiraling thoughts always come out of nowhere. 

Whenever I take my meds I get reminded of the fact that I will be taking them for the rest of my life. That I'll never be ""Normal"" and that I might not get to a state where I can call myself happy. 

... Yeah back to the question... How do you guys live with this? How do you cope with the fact that we're not normal? Just... How?",Bipolar

I’ve officially made it past the one year mark of my major manic episode post diagnosis. 2018 was really hard as I was in a depressive episode and had to work through medication and side effects for the first six months. 

I started a new job in September and started taking improv classes in May. Things are finally at a relatively calm place—for the first time since my husband and I got married in 20-5, it looks like we might have a nice quiet year without any major life changes (that happened to me in prediagnosis manic episodes)

We know that stability is never guaranteed. My goal this year is to do everything in my power to stay stable, and be able to steer through an episode if/when one comes up. So, what does stable mean to me?

S: Sleep. 8-10 hours, one hour without electronics, in bed by 10:30, out of bed by 7:30 
T: Therapy. Going to personal and couples therapy, meditation, journaling, being kind to myself through self talk. 
A: Activity. Working out consistently, more walking and biking as transport, being outside more
B: Balance. Work vs life, alone vs social, self care vs being productive, comfort vs growth
L: Learning- less tv, more books and hobbies. More improv!
E: Eat healthy, drink water, take meds and vitamins

It’s a tall order. I’m probably not going to be able do to all the things all the time, but it’s easy for me to remember and my ultimate goal is to be healthy. What about you?",Bipolar

34201,"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.

As a preface, I’m a 24 year old woman.

About a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.

I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.

I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didn’t think it was anything to worry about.

Again, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.

I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didn’t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didn’t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. 

That day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. 

When I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. It’s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.

Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.

I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. It’s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but it’s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.

I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, I’m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been – but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).

Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. I’m struggling to meet deadlines at work. I’m letting my house go to shit. 


 I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. I’m so depressed. I’m missing out on so much. 

Any words of advice would be so appreciated.

I'm very new here so please forgive me if this has already been discussed...

I was recently diagnosed and prescribed Lamictal (this happened two days ago). I've been seeing a counselor for some other issues and she recommended going to psychiatrist.

My therapist/psychiatrist recommend keeping track of my moods. This seems so easy...So I write down how I'm feeling or rate how I'm feeling. I've been trying to do this for the past month. I have found it so hard to identify my emotions/moods/feelings.

I sit down and either use an app (Dayio, Evernote...) or a physical notebook to start my journaling. I get in my own head so much that I can't seem to figure out how I am feeling. Lately, it feels like I am making it all up. I overthink it all so much that I think ""Oh nevermind...I'm fine"" and just move on with my day. I guess my question is...how do others track their moods/feelings? 

Are there are tips that you have for someone recently diagnosed and feeling like they have still made it all up (even though, logically, I haven't)? Have other experienced this?

Thanks a bunch!",Bipolar

This will help ease stress, anxiety and help you be in the moment. Hope this reach as many as possible :) Hi there, so this playlist (available at both Apple Music and Spotify) came to life almost a year ago, when I'd finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds.

Easily explained:You may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system, which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. Well, research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system, called rest-or-digest, which helps lowering your heart rate, ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things. These system is, just like our f-o-f response, is inherited from our ancestors. We believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds, rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations. Birds singing meant that there were no large predators around (as well as good soil), rain meant crops would grow, fire that they would survive the night and so on.

Hope this helps everyone it reaches!

I am in so much pain i do not know what to do. even now i have the choice to end it all but i do not think my dad deserves this. maybe I am just making excuses for myself. if i die, who will take care of my cat anyway? i wish i could restart this life. just venting, not in need of any kind of help",Suicidal

My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on, and I kept coming to the worst conclusions -&gt; this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year, and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.

Now, 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed, nothing major, I assumed it was due to the winter coming, messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed, what is happening to me, am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor, saying that I felt off, a bit emotionally numb, and racing thoughts 24/7. I took a depression test there, but kinda showed nothing, so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions, which I have had nothing of, never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.

So I slowly started thinking about the questions, what if I am gonna hallucinate, see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 24/7 dp/dr, constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode, recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings, telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.

I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist, with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack, I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before, thinking that I must be super crazy.

Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations, and I described again the same things. That I've never had them, never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something, delusional thoughts pop up in my head, because of my obsession about the fear: ""what if I thought someone were actually following me"" etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real, but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis, because she thinks I am that apparently, even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.

This is throwing me off, what the f is happening. Am I losing control, I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now, stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings, I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????

50329,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II yesterday. I guess it's my life now. Hey everyone, I (18M) have had a mental illness all my life. That being ADHD. I was on Medication for it for about eight years, until last year, when I began to feel... different.

My ADHD used to consist of hyperfixation, hyperactivity and inability to concentrate- so normal ADHD stuff, but last year before I graduated high school in May, I noticed something was changing. I assumed it was my ADHD, just evolving with new symptoms as I got older but towards Graduation time and shortly thereafter, I realized I was wrong. 

It began to get worse with huge depressive episodes, I would cry, or feeling like crying some days, and be fine the next. And I would feel worthless, like I didn't mean or contribute anything, and then have confidence that soared through the roof. I started snapping on people and then being okay the next second. 

The anger and mood swings problems got worse within the past few months. I work retail, and I've been showing attitude and anger and even hatred one moment, and then I'm super happy and energetic the next second. Even outside of work, I snap at my parents, my best friend and have constant negative emotions. I have started talking super-super fast without realizing, and feel like my thoughts are going a million miles an hour. (MY Psych mentioned this to me yesterday). 

One of the biggest things that coincides with the anger and mood swings is my impulse control and motivation. One thing I lack is impulse control, I know something is wrong, but I still choose to do it anyway. This has affected me with porn, gaming too much, and most importantly- spending. I have credit cards and I paid them off a month ago, and once again I have a huge balance on both, because I know I shouldnt be spending money, but in the moment it feels like I should. Also the lack of motivation issue is *huge*. I want to go to the gym, I want to go out and do things, but I just *can't* no matter how hard I force myself to try.

After an argument with my mom about how she's worried about me and how she knows something is wrong, I came clean and told her that I've been keeping how I've been feeling from her, my dad, sisters, and my psychiatrist and therapist. I was afraid to be on new medicine and to be diagnosed with something new. My psych told me that sometimes ADHD can evolve or even be mistaken for Bipolar, since the two share similar symptoms. I was put on Latuda yesterday, and I feel no difference yet, since it takes 3 weeks or more to do so, but I'm hopeful. And hopefully I can learn to live with this since it's a part of me now.",Bipolar
45401,"Ketamine Therapy So the other day I'm on the net and I see an ad for a ketamine clinic that promotes it for bipolar, but provided no information. I requested the science to support their claim, and sent it to a scientist to back up what I had read. Thid scientist was also part of the DC ketamine trials and helped analyze the information. We were of the same mind. Good in theory, but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure, but bipolar is a different kind of beast. Anyways I get a call from the doc that runs the cliinic. We talk for about 15 minutes and I get all my questions answered. They claim an 80% success rate. That seem super high for me. Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate, but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat, especially if there's a 20% failure rate. I would mean regular maintenence doses and stopping meds, which scare me.

Not a dream job per se, but one supposedly reachable, right?At the beginning of high school, I decided to learn Swedish and fell completely in love with the language, the culture, the country as a whole. My goal to be a regular French teacher evolved and now I would absolutely love to become a French teacher in Sweden.But it feels doomed to failure and it is seriously eating me up.Why? Well, I stutter and have other speech issues. My stutter is not that terrible unless I am in a stress-inducing situation, there it can get pretty bad. Even worse, I tend to... dissociate (? I do not think this is the right word) after a bad stutter. This is a terrible thing to happen as a teacher, right?I am also anxious, have very low self-esteem and my social batteries run low most the time. What if it is too much work for my apathetic ass? What if I am not good enough? What if students do not like me? What if they make fun of my appearance? Of my stutter?My anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia. I was never able, in school, to stand up and go to the blackboard. I was never able to speak in front of other people. At the end of my second high school year, I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers. I broke down. The girl, and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort, had to hug me to calm me down (first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten, when my pet bird died, so this hug really meant a lot to me). Being looked at, or just being noticeable, at best makes me uncomfortable, at worst makes me freak out.How am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions? Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this job?Actually, I thought about working all alone in nature, something like that. Sadly, my academic profile is literature-oriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine. Places are limited and usually very far from where I live.

For the first time in years, a bunch of positive stuff is coming together for me: I'm (for the moment) financially secure, my job is challenging but not overwhelming, I have the chance to work on a really cool project, the weather is nice (where I am), I've been running again and signed up for a race, and after careful tapering, I'm down to my lowest daily dose of Klonopin in 9 years. 

For someone without bipolar, it would be obvious that this combination of things would make someone happy, and you wouldn't question that this is a great thing! But since I have bipolar, I'm already like: am I happy or am I *too* happy?

It just seems kinda unfair that we can't just be happy when nice stuff happens to us. People with unipolar depression who begin to feel less depressed have nothing to fear (unless their SSRIs make them manic and turn into one of us, mwahahaha). People who have anxiety and become less anxious--great! People with bipolar who finally reach a balance...nope! Better be on the watch for hypomania!

15961,"So, growing up I played a lot of this game called ""Roblox"", I am sure by now everyone knows what it is but basically it is this lego-kind of game where you can create your own places and avatars and the such, I had a bit of an addiction to it for a shamefully long time. I met many people there, and even ""dated"" (with other people my age), but I feel extremely gross looking back. At one point, i had even begun looking at RR34 (basically Roblox Hentai.) and I even almost messaged one of the creators of that stuff, assuming they were an adult, which is dumb in hindsight. I do not remember if I was actually going to or not, but I feel extremely shameful and guilty regardless. I never had any predatory intentions but looking back now, it would be really creepy for an 18 year old to be doing the kind of stuff I did and I feel really guilty and scared I could have accidentally gotten someone hurt, because most people that play are obviously underage. I am really scared now that I am somehow a p*do or that everyone would think i am because of this embarassing and horrible crap I feel scared that I am a p*do",Suicidal

51506,"How do you even expose yourself to the public or gain ""experience"" when you are 30+? I have been hiding from people for so long. Even when I was going to school I was finding ways to hide from the world. 

I got sad again and randomly searched ""avoidance"" on YouTube and one video that popped up was from this guy called Dr. K. I guess he's a popular mental health streamer on Twitch and a psychiatrist who works at Harvard.

I don't really play video games anymore, but I do think I have an internet addiction. Back in the day I definitely used video games as a crutch and it prevented me from being outside and meeting people, so I do relate to those who have gaming addiction + avoidance. A lot of the points he was making in his videos resonated with me. He talked about how a lot of gamers are actually fairly smart. Now part of this felt like he was blowing smoke up his audience's ass, but on the other hand, I can see a lot of introverted, smart, but shy types gravitating towards games. A lot of the people I knew growing up who gamed were pretty smart people, even the ""lazy"" ones who never amounted to anything in life.

Now, the part that I wanted to go over was the avoidance aspect of life. He mentioned how a lot of these gaming addicts are told they are smart and find school to be fairly easy early in their life, so they don't really struggle early in life, but later as they get older they lack the necessary abilities to succeed. Their self-conscious nature makes them wilt under the pressure of being judged. Anything that makes them appear as not intelligent immediately triggers avoidance. What a lot of these people don't understand is that they need to gain experience, not intelligence in order to succeed. 

I looked up Dr. K's history and it seems like he was struggling college student with a video game addiction and dropped out of school briefly to join some monastery in India. He came back and succeeded and went to medical school and became a psychiatrist. So I guess he's proof that fighting avoidance works.

But what do people who have wasted so much of their life and are already 30 able to do? He had the luxury of taking a dramatic step when he was 20 and able to come back and succeed. Not to mention that he is obviously capable of putting himself out there. Again, this could be due to ""experience"" and desensitizing himself, but how many of us would even be able to have the courage to pack our bags and go to a monetary. For someone like me, my mind is a confusing mess that a step like that would be met with a million different excuses to avoid doing that.

I find that a lot of ""success"" stories ignore that the people who were struggling were not as extreme as a lot of people like myself.",Personality disorder

51662,"How to deal with in-person avoidance? Hi dear community!

I have a question, my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.

And I noticed that when he’s going through an anxiety “episode” or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.

For example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will “hide” behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it’s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can’t actually leave. (For example when we share a hotel room on vacation)

I did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate(even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me) but I’m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that I’m gently being reassuring and consistent.

Last year was rough. I couldn’t enjoy anything in life everyday. I mean I still don’t. I stopped taking my antidepressants and seeing my therapist on a random day. I haven’t looked back since. 

I don’t think it’s possible to get completely rid of this feeling. Being utterly miserable, unlovable, a waste of space. It stays with you. Hearing a professional tell me I was mentally ill felt like a truck hauling a bus had ran me over, but that acknowledgment was merely confirmation that I wasn’t crazy. I’m not like the ordinary person who is able to smile without hiding their true self, the person who can be optimistic, the person who doesn’t think twice about hanging with friends and loved ones. 

Man. I am at the infancy of this journey, I am terrified. Every day I don’t want to wake up, but I do, everyday I don’t want to bathe but I do, I don’t want to talk but I do, I don’t want to walk my dogs but i do. Sometimes, all I can do is just wake up. Why won’t this feeling just leave me be? 

But it’s fine. If this is my slice of hell, fuck me someone else has it worse out there. At least I have a community (granted not everyone or anyone will read this but it’s importance is justified), I have a space I can just cry and rant about how much I fucking hate it all and they get it.

17977,"My husband has a ton of his own problems, and has been very suicidal in the past (actual attempts), mostly before I knew him, but he has been threatening suicide since I have known him. There is a bunch of complicated reasons for everything here, but I am not going to go into details. We have a 5 year old daughter. She was not planned, and we were not married. He is not an involved parent. I am basically a single parent. I take my daughter to visit family often. When we are home, he does not spend any significant time with her and he has never done any caretaking. He blames his lack of involvement on the fact that we are often away, and then on his own mental health problems. He blames me for everything.This morning my daughter was screaming and hitting me and coming after me because I said no to something she wanted. I left the room and went into the room he was ""sleeping"" in. I put it in quotes because he was trying to just sleep through all of it, though there was no way anyone could have. I asked for some help. Like, just some backup, someone else to come in and just say no and hold the boundary because she was physically coming after me. We DO NOT physically punish our daughter and try not to even yell. He got up angrily and berated me for not being able to ""defend myself against a toddler."" I figured at that point that I had made the wrong choice involving him but I could never have guessed what was coming. We got to the bedroom door that she had slammed and locked. I was bending down and picking up the key thing that had fallen off the door frame to unlock the door, when he just grabbed the door handle and slammed his shoulder into the door, breaking through. The force was like when police bust through doors in movies, and it all happened so fast.My daughter was standing RIGHT in front of the door on the other side. Like, holding the handle, when he did this. The door knob hit her in the forehead with unimaginable force, and she went flying backwards over some stupid wooden rocking horse that was by the door. I have never in my life been so shocked and scared and angry, I could not believe what had just happened. I ran through the door, immediately picked her up and brought her to the bed and just held her while we both cried hysterically. I know that parents are supposed to stay calm when injuries and things happen but I just could not in this situation I was basically hyperventilating I was crying so hard. He immediately started minimizing what had just happened. Arguing semantics when I screamed ""why would you break the door down?"" (Saying ""I did not break it down, I broke through"" - like, big difference??) And then almost blaming her for standing by the door when no one could have predicted what he was going to do, especially her. You cannot see through a door, and you should just assume someone might get hurt if you break through it with no warning. Kept calling it an accident, and while I understand that it was not the same thing as walking up to her and punching her in the face, he still made an angry, violent choice with no regard for her safety. He also kept saying it was nothing compared to what would happen to him at his parents' hands, like that somehow makes this better, or less damaging.A nurse advice line was called. She is not showing signs of concussion. But what the actual fuck. I do not feel like I can forgive this. I started packing up. I feel like I need to get my daughter away. Like permanently. I admit that in my immediate shock, anger and fear I was screaming things at him like, ""do not touch her!"" And ""we are done, we are never coming back here!"" So after things calmed down a bit, he started what I knew was coming. He started deflecting all sorts of things in all sorts of ways - he all but accused my parents and me of beating her when she gets normal bruises and scrapes from playing/tripping while running, etc. ""because he does not know what we are capable of and he is not there to see."" And he said that whenever I lose my temper and yell at her it is arguably worse and more traumatizing to her than ""this one mistake."" Next he started saying that he will wait til August but he is just going to kill himself. Because of all the reasons, but especially now because I am basically saying we are gone and this life is over now. I understand that suicide is not inherently selfish, but can you imagine being a little girl who got a severe head wound when her dad bust through her door in a fit of anger, felt at fault for standing there in the first place, and then a couple weeks later, her dad kills himself after basically telling her that this ""accident"" is the reason why? she is not a baby, she will remember this, but she is also not an adult who could separate his existing problems and not blame herself. So I am completely frozen. All I want to do is get away from him, but I know that if I do, the chances of him actually killing himself skyrocket. there is no one to call for him. All I could do is get the authorities involved and have him committed or something. I am also afraid to go to my family and tell them what happened. I cannot lie, I cannot teach her to hide what actually happened, that would be terribly damaging. But when I tell them, it is all over. They already have issues with him but they put up with him because he is her dad. They sometimes voice fear about us going home and ask if he would ever hurt us. I have never had reason to believe that he would, but now all of that is changed and there is no going back, whether this was a mistake or not. He will not be welcome at their house anymore, and they will not allow us to come back here.I feel like this is completely my fault. I should have just given her what she wanted before it turned into a tantrum. I should have never involved him. If I had not said no to her and then gotten him involved, none of this would have happened! She would not have gotten hurt in this awful way, and he would not be threatening to kill himself over it. It is my fault.I have no idea what to do. I tried to open a crisis chat a bunch of times before I made this post but I got too scared that they would be like mandated reporters or something, be able to track us down, and that would just make everything worse at this moment in time.

50741,"Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi,

24-year-old male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people (in my case only at work) began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time, a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want, as real as never before in my life, a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.

However, I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies (the gym can be considered as such, but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there). I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation, because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step, but I don't know how to do it.

One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though (other than, well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps) is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sure…

Have any of you reached such a point on your journey to ""normality""? I'm not sure if I'm over-analyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts. In my case, finding friends seems to be something more distant at the moment and I don't know how I could achieve it. However, I will be grateful for every piece od advice!",Personality disorder

50788,"This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do, could have been done better, and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student, I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now, during my clinical rotations, every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged, and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve.
 I am always reserved and quiet, and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option, fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However, this has backfired on me, as I struggle to form connections and networks, losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually, people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible, which makes me feel hopeless. 
What can I do to sustain balance, at least in my mind? In addition to this, I am lonely, and the effect on my already-damaged mental health is apparent. 
Last year, I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable, and I felt liked. But, in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group, I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable, whether I had anything interesting to say, and whether they looked down on me. The gut-wrenching anxiety became too much to bear, and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media, I see how new people have joined the group, formed close friendships, and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.
I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships, sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this ""mysterious aura"" around me, but after a few more dates, I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper, I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So, it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.
I'm sorry if I went on for too long or sounded negative, but I really needed to share my thoughts and emotions with those who can understand. Thank you for taking the time to read this post.",Personality disorder

46746,"Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit, long time no see. I've been pretty well, so I haven't been coming around much.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago, when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II, I revamped all my meds, started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time, but last September I started back in school, and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal, and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions, but I have a 4.0 GPA!

The thing is though, to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication, I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to  be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September, and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September, and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load, and reddit, I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time, and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.

I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario, Canada, where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.

But honestly, I don't feel ""disabled."" I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This, it seems to me, is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either, despite my long track record of being in treatment.

I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word ""disabled,"" its relationship to bipolar disorder, what it means to be given that title by governing agencies, how you feel about the word, the relationship between disability and capability, and whatever else you have to say about the topic!

Also, I just wanted to say while I'm here that this community gave me so much support when I really needed it, and I am glad it's still an awesome community full of amazing people.",Bipolar

25921,"Using a throwaway for this one. Fairly rough upbringing with an alchoholic dad and a disfunctional family. My first ""attempt"" was at about 7 when i tied a rope around my neck, tied the other end to my bed, and pulled as hard as i could since i did not know anything about nooses and hanging. did not have any results apart from some light choking effect so i cried myself to sleep that day. Every time i had a mental breakdown i contemplated suicide though most days were pretty chill. The next ""attempt"" was at 13, i had my noose and chair all set up and i did not do it. I have considered myself cured of depression since then, i got a girlfriend, my dad did not drink anymore, and all was going well. I did have some very bad days but i ignored them and used the classic ""it is going to be better"" thing. Recently i broke up with her and only now do i realise that i was not happy and i was not cured of depression. I only ignored it and constantly looked for ways to push it away sort of speak. Only now do i realise how lonely i am, how nothing interesting ever happens to me, how each and every day is the same, how i have no friends, how i have no one to talk to, how i have to reason to live. I feel empty in every way possible. I started thinking about suicide again and i regret that i did not do it when i was 13.

15649,"When we were still together.23rd of december 2019 my then boyfriend killed himself by hanging in an psyciatric ward. A week before this he had taken a lot of benzos and i had been at a night shift. So when i came home in the morning i went straight to bed. I noticed he had fallen asleep on the couch but i did not want to wake him up. 6h later i wake up and go to pee and whatever you do when you wake up. When i passed the trash next to the kitchen i noticed all these emtpy benzo boxes. I rushed to the couch and he was drooling and could barely keep his eyes open, so i smacked his face (not as in abusive but trying to wake him up and calling his name) he was kind of awake but like a zombie. So i tried to get him to stand up and go to the bed to ""sleep it off"" (i was going to call for an ambulance but a month before this he had taken a box of paracet and i called the ambulance and he got so mad at me) but i did not care about him getting mad, i was going to call but as soon as he got up on his feet he wanted to have sex. I tried to lay him down, and told him we could not because i was tired etcetc not trying to put it on him and that he was a fucking zombie at the time. But he pushed me to the bed and held me down, i almost could not believe it cus a minute ago he could barely stand and now he was pushing me on the bed basicslly trying to do it against my will.He could not get an erection because of all the benzo and i was relived. But he started crying, saying he was not a man cus he could not get his dick up so i started comforting him(?) Telling him we could watch a movie or anything else to get him distracted so i could call the ambulance (i know i should have done that when i saw the boxes in the trash cannot do much about it now) But his ""manhood"" was ruined so he needed to go out and take some amphetamine. And when i tried to block the bedroom door he took his hand around my troat and squeesed and pulled me away and threw me on the floor. He then looked for his wallet and phone so me being filled with adrenaline, got up and blocked the door going to the hallway. He then toon a knife and pressed it against my throat and said ""I have stabbed my brother, imagine what i could do to you"" and i just remeber telling him ""fine, alright. I will move away from the door now"" and i did and he walked off. I looked out the window until i could not see him anymore, and when i could not it was as if my whole body just went numb. I remember falling to the ground because i could not feel me knees/legs/anything waist down and cried while calling my best friend who is on the other side of the country. She had to guide me on who to contact cus shw knew i had made two new friends in the city. So i called them both, 1st had visitors so i just hung up, called my bff again and she told me to call the other person (my now boyfriend and my ex's best friend) and he had to guide me through the phone on what to do, step by step. He told me to get a bag, how many of different clothes and to get out of there and he would meet me at the 1st guy i called apartment. I stayed there for a week, i did not dare to answer my then bf calls, texts or even tell anyone where i was cus i was scared of telling any one else what had happened. So i turned off my phone. A week later my friend got a call from the police cus they knew i was there. And they told me it was critical and i had to get to the hospital.He died that day, and i was planning to follow him to the other side. Both me and his best friend (my now boyfriend).. idk found each other in grief? Lifted each other up, we understood each other and what we went trough so we fell in love, and all of a sudden we both wanted to live for each other. It happened fast, not going to lie. 2 months later we were in a relationship.Now my ex's family is blaming me for his death even tho i had already 'saved' him 5 times from suicide in 10months, before i met him he had tried to take his life 30 times or more. Idk why i let his family make me feel like shit but it fucking sucks and it fucking hurts knowing that these people knew what he had done, how many times he had tried before and now i have to suffer from it. I am still with his best friend, and he honestly saved my life. I know i should be happy with just that but i cry everytime I am alone and i talk/cry to empty rooms and empty chairs, basically shouting at my ex's ghost. Its everything from telling him I am sorry to yelling how much i hate him for what he put me throug.Idk what i needed from this post, maybe just to share it cus his familu does not believe me. They believe i cheated cus i got together with his bff 2 months after his death.If someone made it this far please tell me how to move away from this, I am so tired of feeling like it really was my fault My ex killed himself",Suicidal

47518,"Exhausted/Tired all the time (in denial) So I am a 36 year old male. I have had depression on and off my entire life. More on than off, but my off periods were fantastic. I was capable of pure joy. Energy. Zest. I could be the person that lights up a room. Sorry to toot my own horn. I have always, however, had health anxiety. Worried about this and that, many medical tests, etc.

Over the last year, other than the 2 months I was on Zyprexa (which I guess should be very telling) I am exhausted beyond belief. I am crying all the time.  I almost never feel well-rested. I want to sleep all day. But even when I try to nap I rarely fall asleep. I just lie there and remain exhausted. Physically so exhausted. Last year I had a stupid pulmonologist (sometimes they dabble in ""sleep medicine)  suggest to me that I had narcolepsy. As a person with health anxiety, this was terrifying. I got 3-4 separate medical opinions, ALL of them from major Universities. They all said I didn't even close to have narcolepsy, and that It was my depression causing it. My tests (overnight sleep study and daytime nap study) weren't close.  I didn't believe them. I was in denial. **I think because I used to have times when I felt great and the depression lifted, this had to be something different.**

However, if I try to look at things objectively I have to see that in the last year, I have become a caretaker for my mother with ALS who is rapidly progressing, I have become more isolated and hang out with friends less, and haven't been working on my passion (music) as much. 

Has anyone else gone through *depression denial* and tried to find a medical explanation for their somatic symptoms (lethargy, exhaustion, brain fog, crying all the time) only to get every medical test in the book and have all doctors (and friends and family that know you best and love you) tell you its depression?

side note: I went for a run (while crying lol) yesterday for the first time in two years and it totally took away my brain fog. I still feel tired, but I feel clearer. That was new.",Depression

I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

48122,"I don't know how to cope with my grief I dated someone for over 10 years of my life. My entire 20s. I never loved anyone more. We had a falling out, our relationship became toxic and even as we tried to remain friends it didn't work.

I cut her off last year at end of january/beginning of february. I assumed she had moved on and everything and stopped talking to me.

Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic. 

Instead, she was dead. Her family did not tell me. On tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news 13 months later. I am devastated. She did not deserve to die. I am so fucking angry at myself. I knew she was sick, I knew she was suicidal and I cut her off anyway. I'm angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral. I'm angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and I am dealing with this loss alone.

I didn't message her for an entire year because I was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldn't allow me to even say ""hi, hope all is well"".

45616,"WarningIs this a Manic Episode? [Please HELP] [x-post /r/bipolar] I've been diagnosed with bipolar by three different psychiatrists. I kept asking for different opinions because I thought I was ""simply"" afflicted with major depression (on and off, for about a decade!).

I've finally accepted the diagnosis and started the treatment, but the pills that the doctor prescribed are exclusively to treat symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disease (Lamictal). 

For the past 5 days, however, I've been experiencing something **very** different:

* Some of my thoughts seem foreign to me, in the sense that I **know** they don't make sense, but I am still drawn to/consumed by them.

* I do and say things that are completely outrageous. Even though I am perfectly aware that they are outrageous, I somehow can't stop myself.

* It's very easy to trigger my irritability. I am screaming loudly and aggressively, and using profanity at the slightest of provocations.

* I am vicariously living some fantasies. When I say vicariously, I mean that I am having extreme reactions of nostalgia over things that never happened (fake memories). It's strange in the sense that I **know** they are fake but, at the same time, I believe them?

My head is a big mess. I don't have any answers. When I'm depressed, none of this happens. 

Right now, I feel like I have more than one person inside my head. There is the rational side, the side that is aware that something is off, the side that is writing this. And then there is the unbalanced side, the side that is causing all this havoc.

The only thing that seems to help is to go clubbing, or to a place with a lot of noise. It somehow makes my thoughts more clear and leaves me more relaxed (even without the help of alcohol).

Has anyone experienced any of these things? I am scared, but I end up driving away everyone that tries to offer their help. ",Bipolar

Need to clarify that I am using my wife's account to ask this question. I'm not a person who likes or enjoys social media (I'm an old fart) so please understand I'm only borrowing her account for this. Thank you. 

I hope someone can help me out with something I need to know. 

When my ex (daughters mom) is dealing with a common cold or flu she tends to go into almost a bipolar mania with borderline psychotic actions. She lashes out verbally and sadly physically. Last time a week ago she physically went after our 10 year old daughter. I had to drive to her house after my daughter called me terrified locked in the bathroom as her mother was kicking at the door. I have my daughter now, getting her therapy, and have a 3 year no contact order for my daughter and I against her mother. 

So when my ex gets sick with normal winter illnesses why does she spiral downward like this.? 

Then she blames anyone and everyone that it was there fault. My daughter was asked if she could go and get her mother a glass of water and my daughter said ok but could you please wait a few minutes so I can finish up my last bit of homework. Normally anyone would be ok thank you but not my ex. She started breaking things and basically telling our daughter that she doesn't care about mom and doesn't care about mom being sick and then into saying what did I ever do to you to make you hate me, just a glass of water and you couldn't even be responsible and respectful enough to go get it. 

Now my daughter is not a child that yells back or gets defiant (yet lol she's at least 2 years away from the hormones) and my daughter is very soft spoken and would help anyone who asked. Complete opposite of my ex thank the heavens. 

Plus my ex goes off and on meds for the last 14 years. She says she doesn't have a problem and if she did meds cure it and ya da all gone. 

Please help me understand the correlation between bipolar and colds/flus with a person who cycles back and forth and refuses meds then goes back on for roughly a month no more than that every few years. 

Thank you 


Update edit: 
For the record I don't plan on keeping the PFA order no contact for 3 years. That's what the judge ruled. I just wanted it for 3 months but with supervised visits for a few weeks leading into an actual custody order for my ex to have our daughter 50/50. But because ex was arrested (swinging at a cop and it was neighbors who called unbeknownst to me until the next day) the judge ruled this way. Yes I wanted to just get her out of my daughters life because I was extremely angry for a few years. It was for me. Not my daughter. It was so I could feel better. Thanks to my wife she's changed my view on how it shouldn't be a selfish want or desire. I had to think about my daughter AND my ex and how it wouldn't be a good thing for either of them if I stopped their relationship. So I apologize to everyone on here for being a jerk.

Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 1-2 times but sometimes 10 times. 

I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG, echo, stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. 

I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. 

I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats, few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. 

I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear  while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. 

I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. 

summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline, if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol 

I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. 

Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.
I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.

Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.
I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.

I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99% all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear.

Be it writing a song, painting a picture, sipping tea with a book, a walk in the park at sunset with no one around, meeting with friends or family, whatever. But collective happiness/enjoyment seems unreachable and I cannot remember a time when I could partake in it. Collective would be such as what is going on now with euro football - people at work talking about it, taking a day off for it, meeting up at the pub to celebrate, getting hyper and rowdy etc. I just think...what is the point? A few rich folk kicking a ball brings millions of people happiness, even though their actions of kicking a ball is so alienated from you as an individual? This could be for anything, so it is not the sport/hobby/rally. Could be the world cup, the Olympics, basically anything that can be a collective. Does anyone feel this way or can express this better? Christmas is another collective I would always felt my depression worsening, because it starts in September in the shops and basically demands a collective celebratory approach as it leads into new year where many countries blast off millions of pounds/dollars/euros into the sky for five minutes of collective enjoyment, when it could be spent on health or education or homelessness, and I would rather celebrate christmas enjoying a day, and only a day for it, with good food and good company.

How do you manage it?I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 and struggle with it daily, but it seems to be worse in the morning, right when I wake up. As soon as I hear my alarm go off and I feel that initial exhaustion and reality sinks in, I get so depressed and anxious about the day ahead that it causes minor (and sometimes major) panic and I begin my descent into nervous, depressed, hopeless hell. I battle so hard with physically leaving my bed, getting ready, being engaged at work, etc.I think a lot of my depression is linked to the fact that I am not happy with my job and have no desire to be waking up and going to it. Its mundane and nothing remotely close to what I actually would like to do for a living. However, I kind of fell into my current field when I moved out and I have not had any luck over the last 7 months searching for something Id maybe enjoy.

45498,"I can't decide about school... The second semester just started and idk what to do... I haven't been to school since before Christmas and right now my goals are to take a shower every week and get through the day. I was gone for some time last semester as well and will probably not get a grade in a few classes. This week I met with my school counselor, main teacher and my ""psychologist"" about school. I'm currently being evaluated for bipolar but it seems pretty clear that I'm going to be put on some medication at least, which is kind of terrifying. Though it will be some time until then. 

So, my options are to either take the rest of the school year off and start this autumn redoing my school year, or take 3 classes now and the rest next year. Everyone excepts me to have an answer, but I don't. I can't even answer simple questions like ""What do you want to eat?"". I wish somebody would just tell me even though I know I have to decide myself. I just can't seem to care. I could barely speak and focus throughout the meeting and my mom ended up speaking mostly. The psychologist brought up shortly how I was last time we talked and I felt shameful for how I had acted. I talked with my brother about how things have been lately and he could kind of relate to my ""ups"", only it's from his experiences with drugs. I didn't think it was that bad and it seems he thought he was experiencing a milder version of what I was experiencing. That hit me. 

Right now it's like I'm taking a look into myself looking at things that seem new to me and all of this is overwhelming and having to evaluate myself is freaky. Idk if school thrown into the mix will help, and now my whole class knows I struggle mentally (in Norway we have a main class that take certain subjects together). I've also been oversharing with some people and I feel like everyone is looking at me differently. I feel like a disease and a pushover. I'm making everything worse and being distant to everyone but I can't help it. Mom deserves better than me. Though it would maybe be better to take 3 classes now instead of everything next year. The thing is that I haven't been able to concentrate at all. Up or down. When I was up there was just too much noise in my head and I had too many other plans. I couldn't even concentrate on what I wanted to do and kept jumping between a lot of things. Still I was 100% sure I could catch up to everything in a couple days which didn't happen. I ended up not sleeping making a workout schedule that was ridiculous, especially for someone who doesn't excercise, drinking a lot of Bailey's to calm down (didn't work) even though I rarely drink, then jogging and working out. Then turning really suicidal and lashing out for 2-3 days before becoming numb. I hate that I want to live yet die so badly at the same time. But. This wasn't what I was going to talk about. I was talking about school.

A lithle bit of backstory: I growed up in a small catholic village in the middle of nowhare. In school I had big social issues and was just a loner and I was pritty depressed. After school I just got home and watched TV the rest of the day or playd on console and I basicly wasted my whole childhood alone and depressed. My (family) just neclected me and left me alone. Later after I finished school I was just a mental wreck with absolutly no social skills. I dident realy know what to do so I did a BVB that is something like a bridge year to get you ready to learn a job. Around that time a lot of things cleared up in my mind. I aknowledegd that I am trans but still dident do mutch about it beciuse I know that my family would hate me even more and I should wait till i can move out. I lost around 20kg ( I was obese) and actually had social interaction in the BVB i actually made friends i guess. Then the second wafe of corona hit and the BVB stopped vor over six months and we just got some stuff to do per E-Mail. I was stuck at home whit my Family that i do not talk with and I lost contact with the persons I met. I sunk into a deep depression and the Dysphoria ( Stuff that i hate about myself becouse of gender related stuff) just got whorse and I just wanted to end my stupid useless live. I dident self harm myself I wanted to die whitout pain. I dident have acess to medication so I just wanted to cutt my wrist and blead out.... Sometimes I sat there houres whit a fucking kitchen knive in my hand but diden had the guts to just do it. I do not know if its good or bad that I dident do it. My existance just sucked. I kind of opend up about my mum that live is hell for me and i asked her if i could see a terapist, surprisingly she was okay with that. I got to a terapist and kind of tould her everything... Becouse I tould her that i was suecidial i got put into a psychosomatic facility that I stayd for two months. They kind of saved my live in a view ways to be honest. It was the first time in my live that everything seems to be okay. I turned 18 during my stay there. I am now kind of mentaly stable again. They helped ne to get back in kontakt whit my dad. (My parents divorced when I was 3.) and I moved to him directly after I got relesed. That was two weeks ago. My family cut contact with me becouse I moved to there ""enemy"" and I do not realy care tbh. I am proberbly going to do something like a BVB again now and I am proberbly seeking ambulant terapy so i can figure myself out and actually start HRT. I still have a lot of anxiety. But I can at least go shopping and can talk to strangers. The mascs actually realy help! I just have a lot of fear for my future and coud just need some advise. To be honest I do not realy know abaut what. I just feel lost.

35224,"actual problems mixed with anxiety I have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday (sadly, the weekend is inbetween).  
My BPM, which usually is around 55-65, got higher and flip flops around a lot (it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down) and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher (not to worrying heights, it is below 140) and, what is worrying me, flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements (like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes, even when i am sitting still and relaxed).

This is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids (no cancer fears about the thyroids, i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases, most commonly thyroid stuff).

Now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothing:

Today, after a long time of it not happening (happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis), my whole body vibrated with my pulse (i could feel it everywhere, most importantly neck), my pulse was actually off (too high, above 100 even when sitting, sometimes going as far as near 120) and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. The pressure was so bad that, depending on how i moved, it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick.

My neck was not only vibrating with my pulse, it also got very tensed (not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move, but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it, shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations).

I had these symptoms before (more or less) as i said, and I assume that it is Roemheld syndrome (a benign, but very scary kind of thing) because i know that my heart is fine. It got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before, i could do sports, i am not feeling weak, i am not having syncopes).

Roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart, chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations, similar to angina pectoris, but it is not actually dangerous. Your heart rate is increased, your chest feels tight, you might have shortness of breath, but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. But that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the ER.

I had that today, the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. I thought i beat it, and then suddenly here i am, thinking i got a lung emboli, or my veins are shut down, or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. Or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air (i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp, since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air AND i got a head MRT the year before and it was fine).  


Now, i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this, because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with, but the reason that i am still like 'ya, gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time.  
I lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. I am not overweight anymore.

So, what my anxiety brain thinks is this: Back then, a tumor right behind my sternum, pressing on my heart. Ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff, but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that (obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but NEEDS MRT or CT) and at some point it will just destroy my heart and I will die. Or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst (even tho i had an mrt of the neck (for legit reasons) just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues, noone said anything about veins).

&amp;#x200B;

I am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld, but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer.

As a bonus point, i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently (i probably didnt, but i live, for some time, with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food, but he is careful and i am too, so it aint probable) and the gluten made the belly angry.

I really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld, i will be extra careful about food in the next days.  


I will not eat today until the belly died down (and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case, not a lot of good 'get healthy' food, at least not in my flat) and drink very much of the herbal tea.

&amp;#x200B;

When i feel better, i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly and i will massage my neck as much as i can.

So far i am at least not predialing the medics anymore.

24362,"I have always taken away anything good from myself. I had feelings for someone for the first time. We talked for months on ig and never met cuz there is a distance. I slowly got insecure. Fast actually. I was experiencing my first psychosis too and did not know. So that does not help. The first time i had an outburst i remember thinking after that it was almost like I wanted him to reject me. (But I do not) It was that hard to believe. Everytime I showed that I had concerns about wether he feels the same for me. He would not say much even if i was straight up asking him and then he would talk to me the next day like i was not a NUT. When i get like this i continue to sabotage myself being insecure makes me more insecure. I think it was just all that was left and then i woke up from the psychosis and shits just been heavier and while depressed i decided to ruin shit some more. (I always wonder why he kept talking to me) by removing him as a follower that did it. I fucked it up. I want to change tho. I want to get better. I want stop destroying things that are good for me and all of my chances at living nice and enjoy things without feeling guilty especially if it is for my growth and improving my mental health. And if i fuck it up but i do not want it to be i want to try and unfuck it and have courage. And I am fine with some not liking me but honestly not him not because I do al this stuff to ruin my life, unconsciously, consciously, psychotic feeling the best I ever have or depressed. Maybe i just want to fight for something this time and take responsibilty. His existence like watching his ig stories made me genuinely happy even on days we did not talk. I look up to him as a person. Like after a night out enjoying myself i felt weird and guilty the next day even though i did everything right I was told, and I watched his story and it just give me this feeling that there is hope for me. I could take care of myself someday and feel happy and not worry and not be concerned with much else but myself and what I love. It just brings me peace to know that I have someone like that in my life even from a distance.

I have noticed his overall mood, treatment towards me (not abusive just can be very short and does not really want to talk or do anything with me), and treatment of himself had been going down (not working out not showering not eating well etc) but did not think it was really bad. After a few months of me being supportive and trying to help in any way I can think of he finally said he needs to see a doctor. I was excited about that; he made no effort to make an appointment and has no general doctor. So I found him one and made him the appointment which he went to with no upset and actually for a few days he seemed happy about going and being put on some meds. Hes never been a good eater and ever since the depression hit he is been worse. I have noticed he is probably lost 20 lbs at least (he was super thin to begin with). He used to be super active as well and now he will not even go on a walk.Last night at around 3am I woke up to an incredibly large thud outside our bedroom door. (He works late or stays up late every night and I normally go to bed at a normal hour). I rushed out of the bedroom to him crumbled on the floor passed out. He actually damaged the wall some with going down and now has a gash in his shoulder. He came to pretty fast but was overall super pale shaking nauseous etc. He would not let me take him to the hospital or is not letting me call his doctor today. I am not sure what caused this but I started tallying his calorie intake and he is getting around 1000 calories a day at most and when he does eat it is normally complete shit (soda chips and cookies fast food etc). he is over 6 foot and in his mid 30s. He now has high blood pressure and high cholesterol along with other health issues. I am now super worried and he still has not eaten since he passed out.

26012,"I have been going through a separation this year and started taking Zoloft (mostly only 25 mg) a bit earlier 7 months ago initially due to my first full blown panic attack. I am super sensitive to almost all pharmaceuticals and usually get the side effects only 3-5% experience - usually sexual dysfunction, suicidal ideations, and out of character behavior. Like most SSRI's it worked well for me the first 3 months or so then started doing the opposite and the above side effects become more pronounced so I often stop after 4 or months. I tried many SSRI's when I was much younger and stopped them for a long time due to such experiences. This time was different and I really needed something fast for my sudden anxiety attacks. I stuck with it longer this time because I was afraid I would be more vulnerable with the separation, pandemic, financial stress all happening at once. But the Zoloft was starting to make me feel like I was in a permanent haze - mornings have especially been difficult. I have zero energy until I have my coffee and Wellbutrin (only 1/4 of a 75 mg pill). I have been taking the Wellbutrin the past 2 months to combat the lack of energy and ability to focus. My smoking weed and drinking both increased by 3-4 times in the last 2 months. They had both been creeping up since the separation, but especially while living alone again the past 2 months. After tapering off for about 7 or 8 days, I completely stopped the Zoloft 5 days ago. I am continuing with the Wellbutrin for now. In the last 3 days I have been experiencing sudden crying outbursts. Yes there are triggers and memories that set them off, but how quickly in intensity it gets as well as the frequency (every few hours) is something new. Is this because of coming off Zoloft?

Around mid January, I started having extremely large amounts of diarrhea, probably like 4-5 times a day. Within 2 weeks, I was still having diarrhea but now blood started showing up, and now every time (apart from 1-2 here and there) I have blood in my stool. Within the last week, I’m still going 4-5 times a day, but half of those are usually to pass mucus and blood, nothing else. The rest of the time I still pass mucus and blood, but with normal stool. It might be stress related because college/work is pretty hectic, but I manage and I have no other stress symptoms.

I went to my doctor around 2 weeks ago and he said there was nothing he can do, so he scheduled a GI appointment which is finally coming this Tuesday. The problem is that I read cancer stories from people my age, and they all say they initially got passed off by several doctors because of their age group, and they don’t get the diagnosis until they finally get a colonoscopy, so I will make sure I get one.

I decided to do the treatment for 4 hours and started to become doubtful midway through, however I trusted the process and thought my hair stylist knew what she was doing (after all, I thought she was a professional at the time). She ended up ruining my hair, and it was nothing like I wanted, she insisted that with a haircut it would be fixed and it ended up looking even worse. I found out afterwards that the treatment was very costly despite the initial price she had told me. I hate myself for not thinking before agreeing and now I have terrible hair. I am considering just cutting it all off and starting over, waiting for my hair to grow back. I am just extremely depressed about it because I really wanted to impress my friends and classmates with hair that I loved, but now I have to start from the beginning, hating the way I look.I am sorry if this is a jumbled mess, I had already been suffering from depression and was starting to feel better but this just feels like a huge block in the road.

49989,"Lamictal brain Edit: my doctor already agreed that I can try a lower dose of lamictal, but he generally lets me decide what I want to do when it comes to meds since nobody else could figure me out. Please stop deleting this.

So basically med-induced stupidity is ruining my life. Being smart is my thing, it’s the only thing I have going for me pretty much. I’ve been labeled a “genius”with a 140+ iq for my entire life and now I can’t do basic math. I’m freaking out, it’s so bad I might actually flunk out of school at this rate.

I’ve been on lamictal for years and always knew it made my memory and cognition worse, but it never was that big of a problem because I wasn’t doing anything that hard.

All of that changed this year when I went back to studying computer science in college, something that I was always good at. But now I can’t do anything, and I mean that. I can’t remember anything for more than ten seconds, it takes me 10x how much time it should for me to learn anything and my brain just doesn’t work. I’m a month behind in both of my stem classes. Even when I was in a mixed psychotic episode I was 10x smarter than this, hell even when I was hospitalized I was smarter than this! So I know for sure that it is the meds causing this, not the disorder itself.

I’m scared of stopping it completely but I want to at least try cutting the dose. My psychiatrist agreed that it could potentially help, but he also pretty much said he doesn’t know much about it. I used take 400 and going down to 200 helped a little, so I’m planning on going down to 100. Has anybody successfully regained some of their brain power by lowering their dose?",Bipolar

I’m just wondering what people mean when they say this disorder causes a lack of sense of self? I 100% have this issue but I’m not really sure why? I’m usually thinking of it in a social context because it feels like I’m not “enough of a person” to make connections but I don’t know if it’s for the same reason you guys might feel that way.

I was a senior in college, she was a junior at the time. Everything started off so well, to the point where we both felt like the stars aligned for us. We clicked almost instantly. I would come see her every weekend about an hour away at her college and she would do the same for me. We both looked forward to the fact that even tho we were long distance, we always had a date when we could meet. When we were not jn college, she lived about 5 hours away. that is when things got tough, but we always seemed to overcome every obstacle that faced us. Everything seemed right when we were together, almost like a fairytale. We talked about our future, the thinks we wanted to accomplish in life and everything in between. We opened up to eachother in ways we never have for anyone else. She eventually talked to me about how she is struggled with depression ever since freshman year of college. Over the past 4 months or so, i began to really see it. She never seemed happy anymore, she was about to graduate from college, along with other things such as finding a job and just moving on to a new chapter in her life. The things she used to enjoy, she no longer cared about. She opened up to me about how she feels like i deserve better and she cannot hell the way she treats me. she is come to the conclusion that if we ever broke up, i would realize how toxic she was and that i would find someone better than her easily. I have always assured her that I have never felt that way and she is everything I have ever wanted. she is just incapable of seeing it that way. Its clear that she does not love herself so its hard for her to love me back the way she thinks i deserve. Truth is id do anything for her and i want to do what is best for her to. We have not seen eachother in 2 months since she graduated but she plans on coming over next week. untill then we just decided to take a break. am i being foolish to believe that depression has taken her over to the point where she feels the way she does?

52927,"27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life 
Hey r/anxiety, 

I am in a very tough spot rn, i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years, started my teaching certification programme (in my country you need to do this), but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain, diarrhea, insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job (like a 10 h job) in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services (the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me).
I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies (tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them, if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them, my divorced father had to pay me 112 € a month for instance) and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.
Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library (smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly) as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying, shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. 

As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days, i have lost 3 kg of weight, lack any appetite, have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country (we are in EU so travelling is no problem). I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it (i was paying my fam 250 € a month from the teacher pay), so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. 
I have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.

Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?

However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice (for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden) 
I still say it sometimes, but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. 

My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, shaking etc. I know/hope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.

To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. 

Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.

How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind.

That shit rocked me and I couldn’t handle being a zombie 16 hours a day. So I switched to XR a couple months later. Well jump to now I want to come off it. One I think the depressive symptoms are mainly gone. I just can’t handle the side effects any more. The constant hunger that can’t be ignored, so hard to wake up at in the AM ect. I know this is bad but I stopped taking it for a few days because of hypomanic episode and it wasn’t the episode but not being on it that made me feel so much fucking better. Like I could breathe.

I’m still on lamotrigine and want to go up more since my mood has been a little whacky so I’m obviously not on nothing. 

But have people gone off Seroquel after a bad depressive episode and was your psych on board or did they make you switch meds? Did you just fall back into a depression? Please just let me know any of your stories. 

Thanks all",Bipolar
17393,"I am so tired and exhausted every single day. I am 21 (F) living with my toxic family. My father died when I was 18. But I was not close to him. We barely had a relationship. He never really cared about kids. My earliest memory of my childhood is of him getting angry about some random thing and throwing away the food on the table and then hitting my mother. I have seen my mother get beaten up ever since I was a kid. She would hit him back while trying to defend herself. They would threaten to kill each other during fights. Kid me would try desperately to loosen my father's fists clenching my mother's hair. But I was just a small kid with no physical strength so I could not do much except beg and cry for them to stop hurting each other. This was long ago.One day, my grandmother (father's side) died and I guess something triggered within my dad (even tho he was not close to her AT ALL) and he lost his shit. He started behaving erratically. Few weeks later we find out through an office colleague of his that my father had been fired from his work. We had no idea. He used to go to ""work"" everyday in the morning. Turns out he was just pretending. Through this said colleague we got to know more: he had angry outburst at work, spouting weird stuff. After some more strange incidents (not going into details) we got an appointment with a psychiatrist and my dad was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. This was when the domestic abuse hit its peak. He became way more violent. I remember one day he broke my mother nose and she started bleeding. Fast forward to 2-3 years (I have no sense of time really, it all seems like a blur now), he stopped taking his meds, became super submissive, barely said anything. I realised eventually that he was depressed (exhibited all the signs). Things changed. Now my mother became the abuser. She would tell him to die, how useless he was, what a burden he was on us 24*7. She also started hitting him. I tried to stop. My father did not. He would just sit there and let her do it. I have an elder brother too but he had gone for college so I was the only one who had to witness all of this all alone with no help. This lasted for some time until he actually listened to her. He killed himself around a week after my 18th birthday. My mother found his body in the middle of the night.I am glad he is dead. At least, he does not have to suffer anymore. I do not know.But now, years after all of this shit, things somehow seem to have worsened (if that is even possible :/ ). I used it believe that once my father was gone from the picture, things would be better. We could lead a peaceful life. Oh boy was I wrong! My mother's toxicity oozed out. I think I have become the replacement of my father. Everyday it is the same thing. ""I am a useless, worthless piece of shit. A waste of space. How she regrets giving birth to me. How I am a crazy person who need help..."" and more. Manipulation, gaslighting, mental, emotional, physical abuse- you name it, she got it. I have (and still am) faced it all. I try my best to do all the chores and not make her angry but it never matters. She will find something to mock, taunt and insult me. I have no place or privacy to cry. it is shit.I have kept alllll this shit inside of me without a single soul knowing until recently. I told me best friend. Well, not everything but I gave a general overview. But I keep stopping myself from saying anything (about the present times) because it is all so intense and I do not think she would be able to handle all this. Even I cannot. Everyday is the same. I am so fucking exhausted and tired of everything. I wish I could kill myself but I have wayy too much hope to do it. I truly want to live a happier, healthier life because I deserve it. I deserve love and care. But my god, this is difficult. 21 years of trauma and I do not see an end to it. I wish I would cease to exist. Why is killing yourself so hard? I am dead inside. I need help but there is nothing. I have no motivation to do anything. No purpose in life. Sometimes I think I might be depressed but then again I am able to get up, do my chores. I do not know. I have also started seeing signs of trauma during arguments and confrontations and it scares me. Nothing seems to be go right in my life. Everything is a fucked up mess. When will this end? P. S.

There is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations, or when someone is trying to sell something to you.

So before these situations I often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. This makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison.

There are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. For example, suppose I was buying something from a shop, I hand over my money, and then the shop keeper just ignores me, what can I actually do in that situation? Call the cops? Get a lawyer? What proof do I have that the money was mine and I handed it over? What obliges the shop keeper to give me the item I wanted?

But I am really too much sad because of the ""jokes"" made by my girlfriend and her male friends. So basically my girlfriend has only male friends and I really do not have any problem with that. So in our friends group too she is the only girl. So me and my girlfriend are in 2 common Instagram Group Chats where she is the only female. So all the other people flirt with her, make jokes and she does not care and even replies to them, around 1 month ago she and her friend intentionally flirted in front of me by saying ""can I come to your bed tonight"" and I ignored it because she always says that they are just ""jokes"". But the next day they intentionally made the same joke again, and this time I told her friend that these jokes are inappropriate and her friend talked to me in a rude way with very abusive words and in the end they said ""we were doing a prank to make you jealous"". This really made me too sad for few days, later she apologized. Now the same things have started again, in one group chat almost everyone is flirting with her, one guy even made a joke about marrying her. In the other group chat, our common friend literally moaned her name in a voice note 3 times and she continued the joke. Then the common friend said to me ""your girlfriend is falling for me and she wants to cheat on you"" in the group chat and she still thinks it is a joke. I already have a low self esteem where I always think that everyone is better than me and when I tell someone this they blame me by saying I am insecure. I am really tired of this, it literally feels like that I am a loser who cannot do anything.Also my girlfriend is too insecure too, when I talk to any girl she taunts me a lot and to everyone ""that is cute"". We had a common female friend in that gc and my girlfriend said ""you need to take my permission before talking to each other"". And everyone thought ""it was cute"" because she is a girl.

Hi, idk if this is in the right place but I just need to get stuff out.
I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to. I want to be so capable and successful and hard working but I just want to kms anytime I think of getting up and going out.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

I can't drive, afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so I feel so lonely and depressed.

And I feel so awful for my fiance when I'm literally saying I'm depressed and I don't want to be here. 

I just want to be hit by a car or something, every day my brain says stuff like that and I'm so tired of holding it together.

12372,"Wondering about mental health (depression?) Advice/comments welcomed and appreciated.Preface: I know I cannot get an actual diagnosis from this site, but I would really like to get peoples opinions/thoughts on this. I am just going to dump a bunch of information here, and I am sorry if its too long. I am going to treat this like a rant, so it will not be organized.Over the past couple of years, I feel like my mental health has been declining. In 2019, I started spending more and more time alone in my bed, and its continued on to this day. I have been passing it off as laziness (Ibe been a lazy person in general for quite a while), but I think its more than that, because I used to only have short periods of laziness. In other words, I used to have occasional lazy days, but now every day feels like a lazy day. I sit on my bed, watching YouTube, listening to music, daydreaming, and checking my apps. When I am not working (I work part-time), I mostly just do these lazy activities.I also currently have a lack of hobbies- probably related to laziness. I want to pursue hobbies and interests like I used to. I want to spend time doing something I enjoy. But, I just cannot get the motivation to. I feel like I cannot get the motivation to do much, even low-effort activities or tasks. My lack of productivity and hobbies has led me to think very negatively about myself. I feel like I am skill-less, talentless, boring, and useless. Its a vicious cycle: lack of motivation = not productive = more negative thoughts. I have also noticed that I am not excited over things Id normally be. For example, I recently went on a short vacation, but I generally felt bored throughout it, when normally Id be anxious and excited to do things. I felt like I could not get excited. Aside from COVID, nothing huge has happened in my life recently that would typically evoke depression, so its hard to pinpoint where this is coming from, and that is frustrating. I also do not feel too bad (its like a constant meh with occasional dark days), or mentally suffocated, like people with depression have described, so I am not sure.

25855,"TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now.

Why does everyone feel like they are experts in what everyone else should do? Especially when something bad happens. And most of the time, it's something vague or obvious.

""Break the cycle"" ""You know better than this"" ""Just be grateful for what you have"" ""Live in the present"" ""Use the resources you've been given"" ""Make something of yourself, anything, but don't let your life go to waste"".

And every single time, they're very fucking happy with themselves. NOTHING MORE TO SAY HERE. \*Wipes hands\*

I am probably not coming back here again after this post, but I just want to rant about things and have people that have a proper idea of what I am on about in some manner or other.I am fed up. I am so fed up that I am actually fed up of being fed up. I am even more fed up of the forced positivity. I know that everyone thinks I will get better, but no matter how much you say it, I cannot see it and it just comes across as morbidly humorous. I am only doing the mental health stuff because I have got nothing better to do, I do not really expect it to go anywhere or do anything, especially since every other time it is not, and never because *I* did something wrong, it is always been something or someone else that fucked it up.I cannot even go on antidepressants, rather than fixing my mood they just dam everything up behind a mental wall. it is still there causing issues, I just have no way to process it until it finally breaks through and I am lost to fucking everything for about a week.On top of that, I am just ceaselessly *sad*. Nothing seems to bring it on, I just have some stray thought and suddenly I am in tears. I have cried so much that even though I am not feeling better I literally cannot cry any more because I have just emotionally exhausted myself.On top of that on top of that, I have given up fending off the thoughts. I do not have the mental overhead for it. For a long time I was able to at least *know* that people liked me, and that I was not useless, and that I would be missed, even if I did not really believe it deep down, but I cannot do that any more, I literally cannot. Which leads to another problem, which is that I cannot trust my own thoughts. I cannot tell if what I am thinking is accurate or not. I can tell you that 1+1=2, but anything requiring even the slightest bit of subjectivity is completely lost on me. I could not tell you how many people consider me my friend, and I could not tell you how many people I consider friends, because anything I come up with is prone to changing based on my increasingly violent moodswings, and I know my brain's throwing out bullshit at me but I cannot separate the bullshit from the truth.I also attempted suicide less than a week ago. For some reason the most upsetting bit about that was not the fact that I tried it, or that it failed, or whatever, but the fact that Facebook decided to just swallow my suicide note for some reason. it is almost amusing how much more that bothered me than the rest of it. I am not sure if it is the fact that I apparently cannot do such a simple thing, or if it is just that my brain's struggling to conceptualise the whole ""kill yourself"" thing so it is latched onto that instead. It makes me feel even more dysfunctional than I already do that upsetting my mum (And I assume brother, but we do not really talk about that kind of thing) has less of an impact on me than Facebook swallowing the fucking thing.And yet for some bizarre reason, that I assume is some grim determination to keep things staying the same, I am still going to the climbing wall, I am still doing guitar lessons, I still get up and brush my teeth and shower, I am still booking my eye tests and following advice I am given. I really cannot puzzle it out, and it makes me feel like I am a fraud or something, and I am not *actually* that bad, I am just somehow doing it all for attention even though the evidence is in front of my face that I am horrendously depressed what with me literally having made an active attempt on my own life.If I am honest, without improvement I cannot see myself seeing the end of the year.

49516,"i’ve had a rough week :/ this is literally just me going to vent bc i don’t have anyone rn and i feel like talking to a community that knows what i might be going through is more comforting than talking to people who i know aren’t going to get it or will worry them. 

so last Thursday my friend and I got into a big fight over me not answering my phone , the jist of that is i was called selfish and told i throw a pity party for myself every time I talk about my relationship with my mother ( it’s bad and has only gotten worse as im am adult now ) as well as her insinuating that i undermine their relationship with their parents ( which i do not , because that is not the type of person i am for whatever that’s worth ) and it ended with us blocking each other which is something i initiated bc I couldn’t deal with how uncommunicative she was being it alone interfered with a lot of other plans, like us going to prom together so now im torn about even going to that since it’ll be my senior prom but then the idea of being outside is to much 

so that Monday was my birthday and I had invited two other friends of mine , one of which I was supposed to be moving in with and had been planning to do so for years only for her to tell me the night i turn 18 that she doesn’t see it being realistic , which is fair and I’m not angry with her but it just seems like my life is falling apart , and I know in the future this won’t even matter but i am having borderline suicidal thoughts and can feel my depression getting so ugly that I can’t even look in mirrors or think about my future. 

i feel really lost and I’m trying to stay positive and have my perspective be that of gratitude but I’m struggling and im just so fucking scared about what I’m going to do in my life. I was thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend but I can’t even trust that the thought is mine or just my brain going into overdrive. I can’t even look people in the eye anymore . I just want to sleep and I want to run away and just go somewhere but I know that’s my avoidance talking. 

don’t really know why im posting this , i think maybe I want to hear about your stories of overcoming things and getting to where you are now or just to know somebody else understands.",Bipolar

50193,"i hate the way media depicts mania i (16ENBY) have been told i show signs of bipolar by multiple professionals. they can’t diagnose me since i’m young though. 

this made me analyze my behaviors and realize when i was manic. 

movies and shows make mania seem fun. it makes it seem like a drug. it can be fun. it can be euphoric. but it’s usually so unbelievably painful. it’s excoriating. 

when i told my friends i was probably bipolar they didn’t really bat an eye, they saw me being reckless and doing risky things and they thought it was fun. 

mania is so much anger. it’s such a deep anger, i can’t explain it and i’ve realized that’s a symptom and not everyone feels it. it’s such a trip. all the things i thought were normal were probably symptoms. 

my friends thought mania was fun, they saw movies of people going out and doing drugs, they saw me going out and doing drugs but when i explained what it’s like they were terrified. and they should be. this isn’t fun. 

bipolar isn’t fun. mania needs to stop being romanticized. your perception of reality shifts, you’re angry, and even more angry that no one can help you. you do reckless things because you just don’t care. you’re filled with so much self hatred and if the consequence isn’t immediate death than it doesn’t matter. 

it’s not fun. i can’t explain how un fun it is. it’s so unstable, you can’t control your emotions, it’s constantly changing. 

it reminds me of Vampire Diaries. when they’re in transition their emotions are magnified. it can be fun but they’re usually a mess, hurting themselves, being destructive, drinking, hating themselves. 

i’m not sure why i made this post. i feel cheated kind of? everyone makes mania seem so fun and crazy and like a movie but it’s scary.",Bipolar

Then you spend a time being depressed and a random thought crosses your mind again but just the opposite ""see. The ice cream was tasty. The sun is beautiful, why are not you happy? Get yoursalef back together champ"" and you start to fight again. And that cycle repeats. it is like you constantly beat yourself up for not thinking positive but once you do the other side convinces you that everything/you are useless. It is stupid. This is my cycle. Sometimes you cannot fight this negative thoughts and go into an episode. Sometimes you can preserve your positive thoughts and do well for a while. I am sick of this. If I kew that I will suffer from an episode every now and then and after it I will be back on track I actually would be happy. I could handle this trade of.

17319,"Hi,I do not really know how to start so I will just write my story in short. I am 23 yo (M) and I have been in a relationship once . I met her in school when i was 17 and and been with her for 2 and half years (ended over 3 years ago). She had depression and she did not handle it very well, she did not even try to make friends and she ended the friendships that she already had. She has not accepted any help from her family and eventually it was all on me, I was her only support without a lot of knowledge about the subject. It got harder when shetried to hurt herself, promised not to do it again but it happend again. I had to recruit for the army and came back home for a weekend every 2/3 weeks. Eventually I could not carry it all by myself anymore and broke up with her, one of the hardest things i had to do, I thought it would help her. do not want to go into more details but she took it very hard and it traumatized me at the time. Since then I tried to ""get back to the market"" with no success. I always got positive feedback from other people about my looks, my intelligence and my humor (do not take this post as an example), and I started believing it only not long ago. I decided to work on my confidence a few years ago and I really feel that I improved a lot. For 3 years since my breakup I have had so much disappointments. I tried dating apps, instagram, real life, match ups, but nothing worked. Almost every time it ended by lack of interest or in disappointment and me feeling like a total loser. Right now I am on vacation abroad so I decided to try tinder again. Got a match, we set a date, I got to her place... And she did not answer. Second time that happened to me and got many more stories like that. I am just so fed up with it I feel like I want to give up on meeting someone. I am so tired of expecting and then getting disappointed. I am starting to think maybe it is better to stop expecting so I will not feel like such a loser anymore.

I try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with “Requires excellent communication skills” or “Verbal communication required.” Even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication! For the life of me I can not communicate well with people as I automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside. Even at the small school I volunteer at I can barely even force out a word, I just do my job silently before leaving. They probably are only letting me help out of pity.

He is always there for me (as I am for him) and I truly feel at peace when I am with him, especially when we are relaxed in bed. I told him he feels like a nice warm blanket in that I feel comfortable and safe. I think he reminds me of the best parts of my dad as a person - particularly when I was little.

Most days I wake up and stay in bed until I get sleepy enough to shut my eyes again. I do not dream often, but the peace of knowing I am not entirely there is comforting. Then I wake up to emails billing me for being alive. I play video games to pass the time. it is more of an escape and a way to feel like I did something although in the grand scheme of things, it is all a waste of time and money. Sometimes playing video games makes me happy. Yet I cannot share that happiness to anyone. It felt more like a dirty little secret than good news, that I am 22 yet I still waste my time and money on something that is worth nothing.I do not know why I am writing this tbh.

48769,"Everything has fallen on me and I'm stressed out I'm already spread thin and stressed to the max.  My husband is out of town for two weeks for family reasons and I feel overwhelmed with everything. We also haven't been apart for more than a few days in 9 years.

The last few says have been especially rough. I've been having to drive home in the middle of the day to let our dog out and and give her meds. We have opposite schedules so he usually does those things before he goes to work. I don't always find parking again when I get back from taking care of her either. We adopted another dog right before he left too which I was hesitant to do. In just 3 days he's already needed to go to the vet twice. Once to look at his neuter incision and again later this week for what appears to be allergies or a virus. We have another dog who's been with us since before we got married. She's undergoing chemo treatment but is doing well. I worry about her catching something if he's sick. I've been sleeping on the couch the past few nights to keep him apart from her because she sleeps in our bedroom and he doesn't need to be jumping on the bed. He also wakes himself and me up multiple times a night because of his stuffy nose. On top of all that, I ran over a bunch of nails in the road and of course one got into my tire. I'm also struggling with school right now.

I'm stressed and frustrated all around. My husband left to his dad's home country to bury him and spend two weeks with his family there. I'm glad he was able to go, but I feel bad that part of me is upset with him about leaving this long. I took on all the responsibilities we share plus extra so he could go. He hasn't even been gone a week yet. I don't know how I'm going to keep everything up until he gets back. My stress management techniques are poor.

46863,"Pot induced my mania, is this the new normal? Is bipolar mania precipitated by marijuana use typically one off, or a ""new normal"" in the cycle?  Am I likely to experience full-blown mania without medication?

Some background:

After a period of minor depression I reverted to old habits and smoked some marijuana which caused my first manic episode.  I spent some time in a psych ward and was given lithium and zyprexa, which didn't fully suppress my manic state.  After a couple months in hypomania, I gave my zyprexa to someone else I'd med who couldn't afford them.  I thought I'd be fine, with just a week until my next refill.  I was wrong, and went manic, totalled my car, and ended up back in the psych ward.  Now I'm dealing with the fallout from this event.

I'm 26, and generally high functioning.  I was an alcoholic for a few years and have been sober for about 4 years (it runs in my family).  I'd smoked pot before, but not often because it would make me feel very anxious and make my thoughts race.

Is this extreme episode of mania my new normal or is it likely a one-off ?  I'd never experienced them before.  In fact, I don't think I'd ever really experienced general hypomania before, only excitement related to specific projects or areas of interest.

I'm unable to find much online about this, here's one:

&gt;Clinicians agree that cannabis use can cause acute adverse mental effects that mimic psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Cannabis abuse prior to development of bipolar disorder has a significant effect on first-episode mania and on the course of the disease. Another study reported that using cannabis at baseline can significantly increase the risk for manic symptoms during follow up.

I had about 4k saved up in my bank that I saved from scratch alone, as I would been unemployed for quite a while beforehand and rapidly needed to save money. Life was good, or seemingly so - my gf had always wanted to move to Oregon, and seeing as how I had the money, and a job that could be transferred over ( and she is literally my gf who is moving so I got to come with lmfao ) I took it. I got here with no house, I lived in a hostel for about a month which was miserable and afterwards met this pretty cool dude who gave me a place to stay. Unfortunately the system failed him too and he is being deported back to India, meaning for me I now have no money and no house and no gf and no stability.

It feels almost like you would feel during meditation.

How am i supposed to live life in this society, realizing that almost all the values that define me as the person i am now, are basically meaningless, that i have been chasing illusions of a fulfillment that basically only means slavery?

34581,"Relapse Advice Hello, Fellow Hypochondriacs! 

I've had severe health anxiety for a couple of months beginning around August last year. Panic attacks, pulse checking, spending way too much at the doctor's office, the whole shebang. 

Around February, I got on top of my shit and turned a leaf. My therapy, healthy eating, and exercise finally kicked in and I was literally like a new person. The health anxiety dissipated and I was able to function. 

But, after a dizzy spell over easter and a whole bunch of stomach problems from eating too many things I'm intolerant to, I've had a major relapse. I'm back to not sleeping, I can feel my heartbeat constantly, I'm Googling non-existent symptoms and struggling to function again. I'm hoping this is just a temporary relapse, a speed hump in what has otherwise been a pretty linear recovery.

There was a guy she used to flirt with whom I had a problem. Everytime we fight she brings up how I had created problems with that guy and how she sacrificed her friend for me. For fights which are not even similar to that, she brings up how she does not talk to that guy anymore for me. It is very heartbreaking and sad. We work together and recently she got another offer in another city which we mutually agreed she would not take up as we will be away from each other. This was agreed upon by both of us and no way did I force her. Today we had a small fight which led to her making me cry and beg apologies.

He has never been willing to listen to me, and when I insist on expressing my ideas, he calls me ""punk"", ""alienated"" or ""callow"". He never gave me a useful advice. He's extremely obsessive and unflexible. His neuroticism hits the skies. He talks with imaginary people. He's unable to follow the most basic social conventions, to the point of harrasment in very grotesque ways. He believes that most people, including me, my mom and my brother, are ""zombies dominated by the virtual world and the hegemonic imperial power that displays an upside down world"" (sic).

We live in Venezuela. He believes or used to believe that he was secretely the ""number two"" of the regime, that Maduro qouted his tweets, and that the Intelligence Service escorted him 24/7. He believes that his neighbour, who has been repeatedly harrased by him, owns the biggest child prostitution ring in the country.

Despite coming from a consolidated upper class, white family, and having opportunities in places like San Diego, he never worked. He never provided. My mom, who comes from a family of peasants, has provided everything in my life by nothing but her own hands. When my grandmother died due to my father's negligence, he inherited a ridiculous ammount of money by selling our house. He wasted it all in obvious scams in exchange for literal bottles of rum and whiskey. At one point, I felt anxious about the prospect of him not providing a HOME for me and him.

He has always been a parasite. When he could, he consumed alcohol in copious ammounts and acted very aggresively and disturbingly. He made me cry sometimes. He brought my mom to the brink of madness.

27171,"I am a bubble floating through a vast empty void. I do not know what to do. I wake up every day and do the exact same thing. I feel a heavy force pulling me deeper into my home. The anxiety I feel over thoughts of leaving my fortress gives me physical pain. I have no purpose to move in any direction except back and forth. I sometimes feel that I am losing grip on reality. I feel consumed by the screens in front of me. Dependent on them for warmth. I write to myself every day, just like this. Today I decided to allow the public to digest my psyche. Perhaps to give me a better understanding of myself through unbiased eyes. I am gripped with fear. There is a xenomorph hammering my inner chest plate. Please do not judge me harshly. I am always alone. I should clarify; I have an elusive partner. My partner is an alcoholic drug user with a gambling addiction. They are also a hell of a go getter with a can do attitude. Observance prevents me from assimilation. Sex is a drug purchased with guilt. We have brief moments together where we exchange pleasantries before going about our days.They have a demanding job but are payed sufficiently well, all things considered. I do not have a job. I have had jobs. Too many jobs. I counted once. 22, I believe. My plethora of different career paths has been both a blessing and a curse. I am well read with a variety of skills. I feel consistently overlooked. I am average height. I feel my partner has resigned themselves to the inevitable descent into drinking alone at the video poker machines. We are both 32. My partner is well liked in the community. I am a shadow. I make the rare appearance at a function or two. I typically do not eat. My choice to eat or not to eat will be my martyrdom. I have not pinpointed why my body has become the offering. Although, I can provide a generous list of options. People seem to enjoy my company and compliment me on my looks and body. I am clean, well dressed, and have been told I have an intimidating presence. I hold a conservation well and have good comedic timing in the moment. My jokes are dry. Much to my dismay, I am not a large person. I am frail. I feel myself diminishing. My soul is drifting towards the event horizon. My partner and I played jeopardy once. The fight lasted for a week. I question my memories. When I speak of fortnight's passed, my words are taunted, belittled, questioned, or worst of all... Ignored. A victim chooses to be a victim. The poor choose to be poor. The path was paved for a different vehicle yet only I am to blame if I cannot pass. The fault is mine. My mind drifts through consciousness. Nicotine and constant vigilance vibrate through my sleepless body. My fears are desperate for attention. I exist only for brief entertainment when all else fails. I am the sideshow to a sideshow at a zoo. My only solace is found by translating thoughts into little notes that I leave for myself. Even now I question the weight of my words. My screams are yawns to the deaf. Wailing is no use when I am trapped in a bubble, floating through a void.Please advise. Please advise.",Depression

It kind of hit me, I just feel quite anxious these days, not only looking out for peoples expressions and pretty much I feel paranoid about what people feel or think about me. I have gained weight these days and my family just like to slap it to my face, making fun of me mirroring their inferiority. Which worked actually. I just am so ducking tired of trying to give weight, even I do not really want to, I am literally having thoughts about what if I was fit like a model, I do not look the best anyway, maybe if I have a fit body, and such thoughts. Every ducking minute while I am on social media, I see ya think being woman is easy videos. I indeed liked myself yet people in those things comments just keep apologizing for what they have been through. I apologize that happened to you, that just so sad. I now keep looking out for someone staring at me, what if they desire me but I am underage, my hair, my clothes, shorts I want to wear but what my family thinks what other people think, just everything. I just feel anxious. My parent even try to say bad things about me sleeping half naked, what if a burglar were to come, going out and what if someone we know sees your outfits. Be considerate we like like you, we want to protect you. My country is just so ducking in bad state that i feel like I might get assaulted or die anytime. Feminists? They are just obsessed with how they are addressed, I do not call myself feminists not because I hate woman, first its name is just stepped on already and I think in order to qualify as woman you need to be doing something not sitting on your ass replying to not all my comments. I have yet to meet any active feminist. In a very sexist place I just have these thoughts what if I wear what I wantDo I have to do this because I am a womanI do not fell safe anymoreIm tired of my lifeIm tired of always thinking about who looks at my fat ass, who wants to kill me, who hates meIm just tired of seeing All assaulted woman making me feel like there is no way I can resist.I am just tired of being compared to peoples standards I like you, but I think you would look better if you were thin said my momI just want to be alone do my chores because they are mine not because I could do both. I just feel inferior, I really do want abs but the moment I said I want to workout of course my mom told me I am a girl, I want 6 pack I said I want to be fit again and then she said okay. Why do I need to be this suppressed and oppressed and at the same to need to cope with my future how shit economy is going. I just want freedom, and equality. I am just ducking tired.

Also experience nausea before any social setting/event no matter how small, every single time. I also have car anxiety where I do not want to drive and am terrified when I ride with others. 

Been on SSRIS for years, they never work. And when I say don’t work I mean I couldn’t tell you if I was taking a tik tac or my medicine, I genuinely wouldn’t know the difference. Been on lexapro, buspar, Wellbutrin and maybe a few others. My psychiatrist finally decided anxiety is the root, not depression so I don’t need a ssri. 

I’m prescribed .5 a day, half or the whole thing twice a day. Took half of .5 for the first month and tbh I didn’t notice anything. Doctor told me maybe I need to take the full .5 twice a day, so I’ve been doing that and still don’t feel like it’s doing much. Am I immune to medications lol??? I still have anxious thoughts and feelings, I’ll say though maybe the feeling of nausea before social settings has gone away but other than that I feel like my anxiety is still very present ):

In fact it was one of the only things I could remember- being so young and always thinking I wish I was never born. I did not sign up for this life. When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy. I have been going through my spiritual journey and along with that, for me, was realizing how toxic my parents are in the present but I always felt like I was just making things up. Overreacting. Making a big deal out of nothing.I have basically been begging my sister (7 years older than me) to tell me what happened for a while and finally, this weekend we talked. Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything ""wrong"" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something. They also know I could destroy their lives too. I feel numb.So now I am waiting. I am waiting on my sister, maybe my brother too, before I confront them. I cannot wait to confront them. I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us. I am their greatest threat and it feels fucking good to know that they are scared of me and what I can do. They do not think I have what it takes but when the time comes, it will be a glorious judgement day. I just found out my childhood was way worse than I thought",Depression

My mom overstepping my boundaries and worrying about her invading my privacy (like going through my diaries and journals. she is done it before so it could happen again). Both times I expressed/ attempted suicide I was screamed and shouted at for being selfish, inconsiderate and immature. I am simply tired of existing and no longer want to feel the pain I feel.

So you get nothing. If you say, ""I do not want opiates, I want anti-biotics so I do not die,"" they assume *your abscess is not bad and you can wait.* Because if you had a bad abscess, you would be asking for painkillers. So if I ask for painkillers for my abscess, I get nothing. And if I ask for anti-biotics, it must not be real, so I get nothing.The message: FUCK OFF AND DIE, and THEN we will write you a prescription. we will write a prescription for your corpse.

34910,"Swollen lymph node, goes away as fast as it inflames \*\*Repost from AskDocs

As far as i remember, this began this past summer. One of my armpits would get a painful feeling, almost as if I pulled a muscle or so, but no lump or anything. Then a couple of days later, it would be painful and a lump and what I figure to be a lymph node. It's never more than 1 inflamed at a time under 1 armpit. It used to be just the left, but this morning I woke up with one under my right. I would say the frequency is about 1 flare up every 2 to 4 weeks, moreso on the side of a month. And no bigger than a pea, or maybe M&amp;M. I can't really tell since I touch it, but sometimes the skin appears reddish underneath, sometimes it doesn't. They eventually go down again and no pain and it feels fine. I don't ever have any symptoms of being sick, as in cough, fever, chills, etc. Everything is pretty normal beside the lymph node (if it is that) flaring up. So, something more serious to worry about and go see my PC or just let it be? Could they be cysts that flare up and then go back down? It's not the same lump either, the location changes too. I do have history of healthy anxiety (my fear is lymphoma) and i've been to the doc plenty of times this past year already and would rather not for something like this, especially when it goes away.

I studied college and I still had that thoughts, I started dating a girl when I was 20 and everything okay but when whenever we got a fight the same thoughts just appeared.

I was first diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2019. I quickly got stable with medication until I was pregnant in 2021 and my meds were changed. It set me spiralling and I saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type 2. 

I came off my meds for 6 months last year and stayed pretty stable other than depression. Then around Christmas time hit a manic period and saw a new psychiatrist. This time they said they weren't sure bipolar was the right diagnosis but put me on lamotrigine anyway. 

I've been really good on lamotrigine for a couple months but my husband spoke to my psych nurse today about maybe having some counselling and she said I don't have a diagnosis of bipolar anymore and they're treating my autism and depression. 

I don't know why I feel so panicked and upset by it. I think it's come out of the blue. The fact nobody has told me and they've now told my husband without even speaking to me about it. It feels like they've been sort of talking behind my back and think I'm lying or something?

For someone who has a hard time paying attention in class, for someone who get's distracted easily, for someone who might have adhd, what is the solution from this shitty torture. I cannot keep up my grades, I am hardly passing, I have been listening to depressing songs lately, and even teachers hate me, which is honestly not a surprise because of the marks they have been giving me. 54 in math, and on top of that, he gives me all N's. So I talk to him about it, and he says I would not collaborate with my peers (Never did breakout rooms in my entire math course), I have been handing work in late (3/19 assignments handed in late) and says I have not been asking questions (textbook word problems, have been asking). He wrote a whole essay about me needing to improve on things, but I still never said anything back. I just took it as another one of those L's. Apparently I cannot play sports without 80s and 90s.

12160,"We are not speaking for a month due to a break we are taking. Impossible for me to know whether we will stay together or not. In the meantime I am preparing myself for a breakup, even if I have some faith in the outcome. I have fought hard to reassure him about continuing together, but he is still lost about what decision to make. Beyond this I am afraid of a lifetime where I will never know if he is truly okay.Even if for a day it is easy to think he is not for me, I go to sleep crying because I feel the thought is cruel. He has been nothing but loving from the start and we were happy together. Our families liked each other. I love his so much. A few months ago I found out he has been suicidal for a long time. He told me his dark thoughts and it broke my heart. He did not want to talk about it and was upset that the whole thing came up, because it triggered him. We rarely ever fought, but now he says he cannot trust me. Now I pray to God for the first time so he gathers strength to overcome his depression because there is nothing else I can do.He continues to love me and want this relationship, but fears it might do him more harm than good. I want to do anything I can to prove I am strong enough for this and that I can be his support. I am afraid of what happens to him if he gives this up, which I understand is arrogant. There is no way to claim I am what he needs. But we thought we were going to be married one day. I am scared he is pushing me away. Viewed optimistically, the end of the relationship could diminish potential triggers and give him the space to focus 100% on himself, his way. All of my friends say I need to look out for myself right now. But what on Earth could my strength be for other than him, when he was the first to make life beautiful for me. Because of him I overcame my own depression and became so strong. I think I would be okay, I just would hate to settle for someone else. There is no knowing why he is depressed and what stops him from trusting me. Maybe he has some secret, I would suspect about gender. I would be with him no matter what. Anyone with advice, it is very welcome! I want to be there for him so badly, I am just not sure what else to do but be patient, I have done everything I can. I have cleared up misunderstandings.

Psych says I likely have fast cycling bipolar type 1 and I guess I'm not diagnosed because she's focusing on my BPD first. I've had a really destructive psychotic manic/mixed(?) phase that made me drop out and get hospitalized last year

I don't know whether I should be calling this manic, since I don't know whether its from BPD or my possible bipolar. But when I get manic I get extremely hyperactive next to the usual mania symptoms, my friend just asked if I was on cocaine. I talk like crazy, constantly shaking, twitchy. Its so weird. I'm just sitting here in front of my desk, legs shaking, eyes barely blinking. I feel so amazing yet scared, I'm about to go run to maybe calm down and get some weed

I've had these moods for years. Usually these moods last from about a day to 2 weeks. They probably last longer, but turn more into an irritated mood. I am medicated, I'm on seroquel and while it helps me a lot it doesn't get rid of this. Sorry if this post is all over the place, I'm really not thinking straight",Bipolar

At least twice a week on average, even for a brief period, I am flattened by a crushing wave of fear and dread and anxiety to the point where I taste blood in my mouth. It's a sickening feeling like you know something awful is going to happen even though you also know it's not really life or death. 

But then sometimes that weight is lifted instantaneously through a conversation or email or text. 

My question is what is your physiological and psychological response to that weight being lifted?

21214,"I have had anxiety and depression since I was a kid. My mom left me with my grandmother months after I was born and moved away. My father left the picture before I was born. I always felt so alone and always felt like it was my fault. Like I was not loved or wanted and just there. I am an adult now, married to the man I love more than anything but have always acted as if everything is ok. Always acting strong when deep down I feel so tired and weak and hide it as much as I can. I have broken down in front of my husband once but when I did, I felt so vulnerable it made me feel so much worse about myself. Feeling like he deserves better than me and constantly over think why is he with me. They say you need to love yourself first before you can lover others, but how can you do that when you get pushed down no matter how hard you try to get back up. I was bullied a lot as a kid, taken advantage of, and has made me feel even more and more worthless. I tried to end it all by taking pills once but it did not work and thought maybe it meant I had a second chance at life and things would get better. As I became a teenager, I continued to be bullied. Had no friends, struggling in school since I felt like I did not fit in and made feel stupid even from teachers. Got to high school and it just got worse. I moved away to a new school, new faces, and depression grew more. I made some so called friends that never wanted to hear about how I felt. They were all so positive yet I was the negative one since I just never felt like I fit in anywhere. As an adult, I have no friends at all. Everyone i know is married with kids and always asked when I will have kids. I do not feel like having kids is an options. I am scared of the thought of bringing a child to a world and have them go through the same thing I did. My job gives me so much anxiety on a daily basis. I work with all men who look at me like I do not belong there. Constantly being put down, talked down to like I do not know anything or good enough for the job. I put a fake smile, act positive, but on my breaks, I break down and trying to put myself back together to do it over and over again. Day after day and its come to the point where I just feel so numb from life that I sometimes struggle with how to keep on going. Everyone sees me as a bubbly person but that is all I can show since if I show my true self, no one wants hear it. Sorry for rambling on, I just feel so lost and do not know how to deal with it, keeping it all inside just hurts that is much more and feel like ending it all would just let people I love down, and doing that hurts just as much especially getting guided that I am an adult and need to act like it.

But the symptoms described in the title above were a little... odd. Epilepsy-concerns emerge, perhaps mild, but still leaving me concerned. Could it just be something that had to do with my eyes needing to adjust, or the settings not being correct and thus messing me up for a bit, or should I be worried about epilepsy/photosensitivity?

Thank you.I have made a post on this account before, and writing my feelings out made my pain feel a little more bearable, so I hope this does the same. I was born in a typical central European family with a loving mother, a slight narcassistic father who I dearly love and my two older sisters. My whole life always felt a little bit misplaced. My school grades were always very good, and I was reading quite advanced books from an early age, which had some consequences like; growing up too early and costant boredom at school because I did not get enough of a challange. My social life had been very poor, and I was getting constantly picked on which resulted in a low self-esteem and depression. I was eleven when I first tried to kill myself. I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for about six months, and finally got off anti-depressants last August. (Two years later).This year has been very tough. After I switched schools I have met a boy who I had feelings for and for the first time in forever, I felt truly happy. After being friends for eight months, he lead me in the woods and took advantage of me. Things have not been the same. It took me three months to hug my mom after that. I never told my family, but I did tell my closest friends. It hurted seeing him laugh with his friends, living his best life while I was sitting at the back of the class holding in another panic attack. But I can always remember who was always willing to take a walk and let me rant about my feelings, spend some silly young times together and take on the world like it was ours. It was my best friend, neighbour and someone you could call a blood-unrelated older sister. She took her life a month ago, on the hill we used to make memories on.I wonder where she is now. Dealing with her death has been a very tough experience I cannot describe. Some feelings words just cannot get a grip of. I am celebrating my fifteenth birthday in five days, and I still cannot believe I made it this far.

8139,"So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself, because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe- different dress, behaving certain ways, etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself, my personality, values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like, the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more ""pushed our"" into the world, environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am.

52507,Does anyone else suffer from dental anxiety? How have you cured it? I'm not talking about a fear of dentists.  (Though I have that too) what I'm talking about is the fear of having something wrong with your teath. Worrying about every speck or black spot that I see.  Checking my gums constantly to make sure that they are ok.  I spend so much time in front of a mirror and a light checking to make sure there are no new signs of any dental issues.  This is on top of brushing my teeth after everytime I eat (usually). It's getting so stressful for me. To the point where I dont really have the energy to do things that I want to do or hobbies.  How the heck do I get this under control? Does anyone else suffer from this.  I think part of my fear is that A) I've had bad experiences in the past with dentists/dental work. B) I've started taking care of my teeth now but I'm worried old problems will show up. C) I don't have the finances for something to go wrong with my teeth.

I am nearing 30, and simple things such as finding a therapist or scheduling an appointment feel so completely out of reach, like I am trying to chop down a tree with a tube of toothpaste. I have been struggling with this for nearly 20 years now, and have nothing to show for it. I am still incredibly depressed. I have no achievements. I have held only a few fleeting minimum-wage jobs throughout my life, and never went to college. A few years back I was going through a patch of being less depressed, and signed up for Job Corps. I wanted to make something of myself. Well, the depression came back. As it always does. Only this time, my support network lived 30 minutes away. My chance to make something of myself ended up with me in a mental health ward after trying to take my life because the pain and sadness just became unbearable. Since then, I have not recovered. Every day is difficult. I no longer have my parents' insurance to cover my needs, so I have not been able to afford seeing a therapist or getting medication for years. I have no job, no friends. I am close to my family, and they are the only reason I am not contemplating suicide right now. I saw how much my attempt hurt them, and refuse to put them through my selfish antics again. Why cannot I beat this? Why cannot I do the basic things people do every day, like take care of themselves, socialize with others, and work a job? Why must every little thing feel like I am trying to climb Mount Everest with a piano strapped to my back?I am tired, but I have no way out.

They can give suggestions, like go to bed on time or exercise, but he will not take that advice. So finally, to feel some sense of control in this hell, they suggest something he will like.

I recently figured I might as well try some as I've had trouble falling asleep and I don't want to use heavier drugs to get to bed. Well I smoked a small amount but immediately it made my heart beat so hard it almost felt painful. I had a minor panic attack but after a few minutes I went to bed.

This morning a friend used a knife of mine to cut dabs and some dab residue was left on the knife, I figured I might as well gum it and see if it does anything and then go to bed. I awoke an hour after passing out to find my heart rate was incredibly high and it was also beating weakly. I felt tired, dizzy and panicked out of my mind. I sent an embarrassing string of texts to my two closest friends and heavily debated going to the ER. I had drank a fair bit the night before and I take 5-HTP for anxiety and I was worried I'd given myself serotonin syndrome or that my heart was somehow damaged.

After a while I went to bed and woke up 6 hours later, I've phoned in to work and am spending the night recouping but I still feel off. Over the past 3 weeks I've been feeling like I'm going to die somehow. Whether it's by alcohol, serotonin syndrome, a really bad anxiety attack or something else.

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",Depression

But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love, that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me, that they will get tired of me. i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side, realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid, but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it? Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly, but idk if that is just making me close off, make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels... So ye I just feel stupid because i do actually have everything to be happy and I truly am, i am not insecure of myself either, I am happy with everyone that is with me right now, well my friends let me down a lot but apart from that it is all good, my family, my bf and the few friends I trust. But doubts suddenly invade my mind and do not let me see stuff as great as it actually is. So ye idk what to call this or how to overcome it sometimes. it is not always but when it happens it really puts me down in a fking hole. What does depression feel like?",Depression

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I had to tell her to leave last night but she would not leave I was crying hysterically my bedroom because I am trying to leave and abusive government housing situation.And she did not say a word even though she heard me and I just felt so unloved and uncared forI started just losing it and saying like go back to your perfect life then because I have to live in this awful while everyone else seems to be doing relatively okay and I mentioned my dad raping me which she denied but when I first told her she did not deny it and she confirmed but now she says I am crazy and then it never happened and I have a disorder.I always internally feel like this mentally psycho messed up ungrateful person. I have no friends I cannot keep them because they cannot support me at the emotional depth that I need, they all end up just taking advantage of me and when I need them they are nowhere to be found I tried to just have friends that I can be casual with but they just want to take from me they cannot even just have a conversation with me about TV shows without asking something from from me or making a snotty remark.I have a small business but it is extremely hard for me because it is on social media seeing the numbers go up and down with my followers makes it hard especially as I am becoming more real of who I am. I cannot separate my business from who I am it is very important that I spread awareness about social issues as well as what I went through being trafficked. I am on assistance and I am scared they will cut me off because I have not reported my earnings because if I do that they will cut my check for the next month and since I do not make consistent income it is not a good idea for me but in the end I lose anyways.My building is government they treat you like garbage they take your full amount of rent you get from the government and leave you in an apartment that is a death trap in a fire hazard no matter what you do or you call no one gives a s***.I actually really do love myself and care about myself and there is a lot of things that I love in life but it is getting to the point where how can I survive when I do not even have a decent support network and it is hard for me to even get out of bed. I tried to have my mom help me and clean but obviously the emotions are too untangled there and the way she treats me when she comes as if as if I am a huge burden and I cannot do it myself and she just snaps at me and I feel so trapped. This place is giving me money to move but they are not helping me whatsoever I have never lived in apartment by myself that has not been government I have no idea what they want and they have just basically said we have money in your lucky to have it you are ahead of the edge but they kind of just throw me to the Wolves I am indigenous/white as well and the funding is linked through indigenous funding so as well as you know assistant so I am scared I will end up in a worse place than I am already in.

I do not understand like everyone around me just lacks empathy and any type of emotional intelligence they do not listen to what I want they do not listen to what type of apartment I want and I just want to give up like I am just overwhelmed and these people want too much from me and then they get almost mad because I cannot do it but then they send me listings that are completely what I told them not and I am just feeling disrespected at this point and I tell them but nothing changesI feel like nothing changes ever no matter what I do I am just exhausting myself on a f****** hamster wheel no one can help me no one ever does I do not deserve this.I do not see any light at the end of the tunnel I do not have one person in my life that has my best interest in mind.I do not really want to die but I do not want to live like this and I do not want it to get worse.

27051,"I am sorry this is so long, I just needed to get it off my chest.I moved in last August, we were friends in the same sorority. I will call her Viola. I am not saying I was a perfect roommate or friend this year, I was really depressed and a little negative sometimes. I felt tension from her and started isolating in my room, which I think may have pissed her off more. A couple times I said the wrong thing and accidentally offended someone (nothing cruel, just tone deaf). This was just what I noticed, no one ever communicated with me explicitly.But I always pride myself on being kind and taking the high road. Especially the last few months, I did everything I could to be more conscientious about my words, listen, and uplift others rather than talk about myself. I was never mean to anyone, I always kept common areas clean, but it was never good enough. We were different people with different behaviors, so I always felt like I was stepping on eggshells and ruining her perfect apartment ecosystem. She so obviously preferred our other roommate, who was very sweet, and I tried my best not to show I was hurt.At one point, I asked a close mutual friend, Hannah, for advice. She lived across the country, so she knew both of us, but was uninvolved. I made sure to phrase in a way that was not shit talking, but rather seeking to resolve tension. Hannah assured me that Viola loved me and sometimes roommates do not mesh, but that everything would probably be fine when we stopped living together.Anyway, I moved out at the end of May. I texted Viola a couple times asking how she was, and both were ignored. She was going on a long road trip with Hannah, and I really was just hoping to try and mend things slowly. Getting ghosted sucks, but I tried to just move on.Then I looked at her twitter.Going back through the whole year, she said horrible things obviously aimed at me. Her pinned tweet is ""Before you buy somebody a mug for Christmas remember it is the gift that screams you do not know them very well."" The day we exchanged stocking gifts, for which we had a 10 dollar limit. she is a teacher, I got her a mug about teaching, she got me a water bottle. My other roommate got me a mug. It was not that deep.The tweet that referenced when she said she would feel bad for hurting one roommates feelings but not the other, right in front of me.The tweet from the day I moved out: ""If you moved out of a place, and you leave stuff without asking if the people staying want it - I hate you. Take your shit."" My mom helped me move, she can attest that all we left were some plastic plates and unopened food packages.And most recently, the one from the day I texted her the second time: ""I really want to know, why do you text someone you know hates you? And why would you try two more times after being ignored? Why?? #wearenotfriends""It should not hurt as much as it does. I am so tired of feeling this way.

I went to the Dr yesterday and got an x-ray and and ECG which she said looked slightly abnormal compared to an ECG I had in 2014. She is sending me to a cardiologist. I don't know my x-ray results yet. My appointment with the cardiologist is Feb 25th. Seems so far away, and I keep thinking, what if I have a heart attack between now and then?

45984,"ADD Inattentive and BiPolar II ... anyone else? Hi there, 
I am 30 yo female who was diagnosed as ADD Inattentive in Highschool, prescribed all those study candies and made it through college (where I began binge drinking and smoking pot)... also had a bout of serious depression and started Lexapro, which lasted only about two years . I am very petite and was taking high doses of Vyvanse (70mg) and also Adderall (30mg tab) for studying. I had what I would call my first “episode” in college after smoking a bowl... fast forward to five years out of college and still taking Adderall and vyvanse and ambien, gained about 40lbs. I wanted off of that shit so I quit taking it and quit seeing my doc. When I didn’t have any left since I stopped seeing the doc, I became addicted to Benadryl (3 at night) just to sleep. 

Anyway, I went on a trip and got some pot candy, and I got sick and then I was prescribed a 10 mg prednisone. That’s when the mania started, it was full blown mania for about 10 days, before I went to the hospital. I don’t remember everything but I was signing everything! I couldn’t stop, it was weird. 

Anyway sorry for the long post, my new doc has me on Seraquel 200mg and vistiril along with a bunch of supplements (I am trying to get away from big pharma). My problem is now I am still very distracted due to the inattentive ADD, during work I don’t work and I’ll pick at split ends or google stuff that’s irrelevant. My new doc said NO to stimulants and even said I should not drink coffee. He also said I can do pot or alcohol but it is dis-inhibiting, so basically watch out. Now I am in a depressed state, and I should be happy. 

My question to others is how do you deal with bipolar and inattentive add? It’s a tough combo but I am trying to take things one day at a time. ",Bipolar

What kind of irresponsible and neglectful parent does that shit. And she thinks I am too stupid too remember that. Like I could have drank liquor and bleach or burned the damn house down. And yeah let us not forget the time my mom violently beat down the door in a fit of rage where my dad had to take me and we had to hide in the closet and the police had to show up.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed.

20449,"Hey there!After a long period of depression and being useless, I pretty much fucked up everything in my life. There is one thing that is left untouched so far (school-wise). It is my last line of defence. On July 27th, I will see whether this last line of defence crumbles as well. If it does not, I feel that I can overcome all of this and start a new chapter. If it crumbles, I am done, suicide would be the only option. For this last line not to fail, I have to work hard these days. What left me in shock is that I have NO MOTIVATION to work even if I threaten myself with suicide in case of failure. I guess that makes me emotionally dead already. The date is approaching and I feel like Hitler in his Berlin bunker in May 1945 slowly waiting for Soviets to deliver the last blow. If you see me here after July 27th, I made it and I have a chance in life. If not - I did not make it. My suicide is getting closer and closer",Suicidal
46430,"A story going from manic to depressive Bipolar II explained 

My eyes open. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE. Why was I so down yesterday? Maybe I should go to the gym. No, no: maybe I should get some work done. Yes work, I’ve been neglecting work. Actually maybe I should pay rent, I’m a couple of days overdue. I put on my favourite song. What a great fucking song, my auditory cortex shoots out musical notes like buckets of cum for my vagina of a cerebral cortex to process and enjoy. 
   
First I need to make breakfast. What’s the most optimal amount of nutrients I can make in a meal for my body weight? I research this for a couple of hours; I want to know anything and everything about how nutrients work from the macro to the micro level. I order an organic chemistry book. I order a vegetable juicer. I order 5 different multivitamins and 2 fish oils. I go for a run, planning my ultimate breakfast. I am so excited. I get a few hours of work done, life is so fucking great. Hell, maybe I’ll even find a girlfriend soon. 

Maybe I can share this with my friends. I haven’t spoken to them in a while, but I think it would be really great to catch up. So I plan 3 coffee dates for tomorrow. Perfect, that will scratch my social itch. I also want to get REALLY fucking high. Or maybe I’m just craving affection. Peaking on MDMA and having my first kiss felt identical. So does the mdma comedown and breaking up. I don’t deal with relationships very well. I’m either careless or obsessive. Very rarely do I find a good fit, in fact I haven’t yet. But I’ve learned from my mistakes.

My thoughts start racing. Maybe I’ll never find someone to give this boundless love to. Maybe I’m not attractive enough. Maybe I’m too weird. Who spends 4 hours planning their breakfast? Sometimes I say things I don’t mean. Sometimes I just want people to like me. Sometimes I won’t shut up. Sometimes friends say they like me or click well with me but it doesn’t feel genuine. Are all my relationships fake? I’m definitely overthinking this. This can’t be true.

 My dad comes into my room and asks how applying to work is going, I tell him to fuck off. I can’t believe I just said that. I’m just mentally fucked up and waiting for my meds to work, this must be the case. My friends like me, right? I need to slow down my thoughts, this is driving me mad. I order some ket, haven’t eaten all day and decide to order pizza. I binge and fall asleep. 

I wake up. The greyness of the bleak sky reflects through my cold window. I gather all my strength to go take a shower. I made it to the bathroom and undress. I’ve put on weight. My brutal acne medicine isn’t working as promised, in fact it’s made it worse. I’ve ignored calls from my landlord for days now, there’s no way I can call him and sort it out. I dropped out of school, I’m a fucking failure. I put on my favourite song. My auditory cortex hits me cerebral cortex with notes like harpoons to Moby Dick. What trash, how can anybody enjoy music?

Oh fuck, I have to meet up with my friends today. I try and get myself together and make a lazy breakfast. One friend calls me and says he can’t make it. I’m somewhat upset but also relieved. I meet up with my other friend. We have a seemingly normal conversation but I am fucking shattered. I can’t tell if he can tell or not. I leave the conversation feeling defeated, I’ve had so much to say and nothing but small talk left my mouth. He must think I’m boring, I despise being boring. 

I return home to find my books, vitamins and juicer waiting for me in a parcel at my doorstep. I’m never gonna use this shit, what’s the point? Ah but yes, my ket arrived, I’ll get a couple of hours of peace completely zombified. 

My dad calls me when I’m all fucked up. He can tell I’m fucked up and he’s worried I’m going to overdose. I try to pretend to be sober and he tries to pretend to believe that I’m sober as to not upset me more, it’s the saddest thing in the world. He drives me to the emergency unit and I get my vitals checked, all is seemingly fine. My parents have been nothing but supportive and I’m still like this. My phone dies and I can’t get it to work, my last friend completely ghosted and in my mind gone forever. Maybe some day I’ll get better, I’m just waiting for the meds to work. I fall asleep.

I wake up, WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE.

50327,"Psychiatrist belittling me First time poster on this sub, but I feel like I need support. Sorry for the format, I am on mobile. 

I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. 

I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist, but he doesn't seem to care.

What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6, I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no, I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey, so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. 

To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster.

 I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy, that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight, that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time, and I just want to be taken seriously. I see now why so many women struggle to get diagnosed; ""it's all in your head"" or ""that's just normal for a woman to be moody"" 

Have any of you ever had this happen on your journeys to getting help with your diagnosis/treatments? I want to know I'm not alone...",Bipolar

After the visit, I called him back. He asked when I was coming to visit, I a started explaining how my current mental health is making it difficult to leave the house, let alone get into a car. Or a bus! His immediate response: 'are you still letting that old shit affect you? You just got to shake that shiy off, or you are allowing it to ruined your life.' I had to hang up. I have been subjected to child neglect, child abuse, domestic abuse, and it is taken me until my 40s to realise it was not all my fault. Yesterday felt like the last straw. I have battled NHS for 2 years to get some meaningful help, and I am still in the 'fighting' period. I am not getting any help that makes a difference.

As my dad died when I was nine years old, I thought during the past two years he died due to a suicide believing he jumped off a building, at-least that was what I was told he fell off a building far away from my house for unknown reasons.I held to this thought for two years and spent countless nights crying through anxiety and panic attacks as well as harming myself to cope. Until I got the courage to ask my mom and new stepdad what has happened with my dad regarding more context on how he died. Turns out my parents were hiding information from me that he died falling off the balcony of my house because the railing tore off while he was leaning on it. I am still not sure if that is the truth, but sense then I have never entered my balcony. These hardships found their way into my daily life where I found it very hard to interact with people sense I was young altho I desperately wanted someone to interact with. This coupled with fact that I am on the autism spectrum did not do me any favors. I was bullied relentlessly in high school for rumors spread by bullies of me being gay (I am bisexual) and awkward. I always went home in a bad mood because of this. Faking sicknesses and throwing up on purpose so I could miss the next school day to avoid my classmates. I spent those days in my room in physical pain because of my panic attacks rather than studying for the classes I missed. I was always jealous of people with many friends and especially partners, because I was in great physical shape and conventionally attractive I just do not know how to interact with people and I thought having someone to love would solve my issues. When COVID-19 hit I no longer could go to the gym which was keeping me together in a sense. All these issues got worse 10 fold and because of that I began going to abandoned buildings near my area looking down and convincing myself to jump like I thought my dad did, and I almost succeeded. As a last resort I decided to open up to one of my three close friends on what I was going through and he helped me regain some sanity, that I was worth something and I should not be ashamed of what I am. All in all I thought I got rid of these thoughts habits and pains more recently, I improved my grades got accepted to a great prestigious college and heading towards the future. Until one of my friends managed to get a partner I congratulated him but got jealous.

What can I say? I'm depressed, very hard to find motivation to move on, to complete tasks. I'm in college now, and studying became so hard I can't describe. In school I was one of the best students and a couple years later remembering and learning even a tiny pieces of new information is extremely hard. Even if it's something relatively easy.

I don't believe I'll be able to finish college, find love(I'm really bad at social interactions and meeting new people), find a job, and become happy. Every day it is only harder and harder to move on and deal with problems.

Who was I before? Am I even any different? Sleep used to be my escape from myself but my dreams are vivid and awful now. The anxiety has crept into my unconscious. I am alone inside of myself. I have been taking lamictal for 15 years and recently I have gone without them for a few weeks due to unfortunate circumstances. I know I am experiencing withdrawal from them. My mind is foggy and distracted. I cannot concentrate on even a television show I enjoy. The things that used to soothe me are no longer working. Every day is the same as the last in my mind. I tried to quit smoking cigarettes...but I cannot seem to let go of them. My therapist has me confused and scared about what could be wrong with me mentally. I have broken up with a very close friend because they accused me of being selfish and toxic. Maybe I am. But I am just trying to survive. I do not want to die. I just want to be okay. I cannot work. My finances are being taken care of by my 60 year old mother who works overtime to support me through this. I am forever grateful for her sacrifice. The shame of not being able to support myself as an adult is weighing heavy on my self worth and esteem. I am in a very dark place and I am afraid. Sometimes I lay in bed and think about all the people in the world and how a lot of them feel lost or scared or just empty like me. How can I be on this planet with so many people and feel completely isolated. My friends love me. My family loves me. My boyfriend loves me. I know this. But it does not cure me. I am my own enemy.

50538,"Do I keep looking for a medication that works or is this as good as it gets? I've asked a question to you guys in the past regarding the end goal of being medicated. I'm on 1200mg of lithium carbonate, 250mg Divalproex and 150mg Bupropion HCL XL every other day. I've noticed a good improvement on this cocktail, most recently upped the dose of lithium to 1200mg and I felt like I was doing better, but it's been 3 months and I've had 2 episodes since the increase....These episodes are usual at this time of year so it didn't cause them, but they're still there, a bit more manageable and definitely not ruining my life like before, but I do not feel like a normal functioning human being. I'm still experiencing mania, but I'm able to stop myself from spending excess money and I am able to notice the energy I'm expending so I can force myself to relax here and there so I'm not deprived. I still sleep less, but enough to function so that's good. I can't stop myself from picking up my phone and googling everything on the planet that comes to mind...I feel like I have ADD or something, literally no focus at all which is not good for work. I still have significant periods of anxiety and stress about nothing and I'm finding this hard to manage, and the depression is still there, but my body no longer feels like cement, although I'm usually tired even after sleeping 10-14hrs. I can still force myself to get up and do stuff like clean, shower, etc. But I'm extremely miserable about it and everything else that doesn't involve sleeping., I don't cry omw to work, during work and while showering anymore, I don't have ""those scary thoughts"" anymore and I can keep a gym schedule although during my depressive periods the amount of gym sessions I get in are significantly less. 
Is this it or should I keep trying to find a better state to be in?  I mean I can live with it, but it sucks to go through this rollercoaster of emotions and energy expending and depleting, even if it's just a mid-sized one. I cancel a lot of plans on friends often because the way I feel when making them is not how I feel when the date arrives, I still have these insane urges to make plans with people and go out and socialize, shop, google search like mad and try new stuff, I still sleep less and more depending on what stage I'm in, I still overstress over everything and panic, I still feel drained and prefer to be alone and do nothing for a month or so straight.

The study, which analysed data from 522 trials involving 116,477 people, found 21 common anti-depressants were all more effective at reducing symptoms of acute depression than dummy pills.

But it also showed big differences in how effective each drug is.""

Major takeaways: 

EDIT: Anti depressants do work better than placebos for most people but their effectiveness varies.

More people could be helped by anti-depressants.

Anti depressants don't work for everyone.

50370,"Trying to fix all the damage I caused Long story short, I was diagnosed with depression back in 2021 after a rough year and 2 failed suicide attempts December 2021. Physically and mentally I made a full recovery by May 2022, my ex of 7 years cheated on me in June and I surprisingly dealt with it really well. I’d been off work March-September due to factors outside my control which was stressful but again, I dealt with it well. I returned to work and on one of my first days back the most beautiful woman I had ever seen walked into the office. I’m a confident bloke but I was nervous AF! I spoke to her for a bit and thought there would be no way she would like me, fast forward a few hours later and she’d requested to follow me on instagram and we got chatting. We met shortly after for a date and it was like we’d know each other years, best date ever. From this point we both took it slow and just let things happen naturally. The connection we had was unlike any other and for both of us to feel the same was just unreal. I asked her to be my girlfriend in October and she was genuinely excited about it, this made me realise I’d found someone special. Shortly after this I had a serious family emergency and that was ongoing till January, she was my rock, my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. I’m 29 and I’ve cared for people a lot in relationships but never been in love despite them all being long term. I thought I was incapable but this woman changed that and she’s the first I’ve ever loved, and hopefully the last. On 02/01/23 the family emergency situation came to a close with expected but still devastated news. From this day on my mental health started to deteriorate but predictably, nothing too rapid. 05/01/23 I went over to my Nan’s house late at night after work to drop a birthday card off for her birthday the following day. I walked in to find her dead on the kitchen floor, this was the day I deteriorated rapidly. I needed my girlfriend desperately for support but I was just far too much to deal with. I wasn’t just depressed, this time it was different. I was awake 4-8 days regularly and would only sleep when I’d black out. I was exhausted but completely and utterly hyper fixated on anything that came into my head. Because it was my girlfriend who had become distant I stupidly bombarded her with messages begging for help and reminding her how much I love her. She wasn’t leaving me she just needed space and I could cope on my own. 20/02/23 2 men tried to steal my car and I managed to keep the car and defend myself but suffered some bad injuries in the process. I was hit 11 times with a knuckle duster and 40+ times by the other bloke with just his fists. I was left with 4 skull fractures, fractured orbital bone, broken nose and broke jaw. I’m an ex professional Muay Thai fighter so I’m used to a certain level of pain and discomfort but this was different, although I now have slurred speech, blind in my right eye and have lost substantial weight this hurt me mentally. I started to have panic attacks and I was going through episodes of what can only be described as mania and borderline psychosis. Again I continued begging my girlfriend for help and pushed her even further away, shortly after this she ended things. She made the right decision because I was horrendous and I was dragging her down. This present day I’m on the mend now and I barely remember any of it, the days all merged as one. It feels like someone else has been living/wrecking my life and last week I woke up and have been given it back. I’m now trying to fix all the damage I’ve caused, I’ve lost most of my friends, family and the love of my life. I’ll never give up on her but for now I can only love her from a distance. I hope one day soon she forgives me and wants to speak again but I also need to get some advice if anyone has experienced this before. I’ve spoke to numerous Dr’s in and outside the hospital but have just been dismissed as I struggle explaining it and play it down. Thanks in advance and apologies for the long read",Bipolar

46481,"I miss my bestfriend so much[venting] The only person who had kept me under some sort of control for the past year and a half, my former bestfriend, cut complete ties with me a few days ago. Told me to never contact her again. Now I feel like I'm in hell. I have a family. I have a handful of friends. But I can't build a real, trusting relationship with them. I’ve tried so hard. I have some really bad trust and attachment issues because of my dad leaving when I was 5. And then when I was 12, my mom also left(but thankfully my dad took me in and raised me from then on). This has left me in a way that I can only do one of two things. Either not get attached at all, or get extremely attached. But because of the extreme attachment leading to hurt in previous relationships, I had purposefully put space between me and others.


She was the first person in a long time who I really opened up to and let in. I thought she was doing the same to me. We were so insanely close. Then I did one dumbass thing, which I didn't realize was a dumbass thing, and she just turned cold on me. It's like, all the stuff she told me about how much she needed me, how much she loved me and how she would be devastated with me, just disappeared. I've spent the last several weeks trying to fix things, with her warming up a bit, then turning cold, then warming up, then turning cold. I can't put all the blame on her for this. Me going from begging and pleading for forgiveness, to yelling and screaming at her for abandoning me, and then back to the other one, made the situation way worse. But I was at such a low point, I was actually planning my suicide and I was just desperate to have her back. It was so painful and anger inducing that this person, who I gave everything to, didn't even care about it. I put her in front of me. I have suffered, so that I could make sure she didn't. I'm not an innocent angel in all of this. I'm clingy, I'm needy, I'm unstable and high maintenance. I also have extreme mood swings. But I also loved her. Fully and completely. I thought she knew this. 


I was willing to do anything it took to make her want to stay. I tried everything I knew. But it all failed. After one too many fights, things are at a definite end. There is no going back. Now I'm feeling so isolated and alone. The only person I could talk to, hates me. It feels like no one else is even trying to understand me.


To them, ""she's just some girl. Just move on."" They don't know her like I do. She's amazing, in every way. The day after I attempted suicide last March 25th, I was in the emergency room, alone. I was so scared and I had no one to talk to. She called and texted me as much as she could(she works as a waitress). Kept telling me that things will be okay and that she would be there for me. That’s what made her so special. When everyone else was freaked out and pushed away, she would run forward and try to help me. And I lost that.


All I can think about is that it took me 23 years to meet this one person who I got along with on such a deep level. Is it going to take another 23 to meet the next? And even if I do, they will never be able to replace her. It was nice to be in a relationship(whether it be friends, romantic, or familial) where I felt like I could just fully and completely be myself. I just miss her so much. The depression and stress I'm feeling from this is making my bipolar disorder spin out of control as well, which is just fucking annoying as well. When I met her, I was at a point where all I could think about was killing myself. I felt there was no hope. Nothing would get better. Now, without her, I'm basically back in that headspace and it sucks. I just feel so hopeless and empty. It hurts to breathe. Every morning, I wake up and I feel ok for about a minute. Then reality comes crashing in and I just cry till I can’t.

24234,"How do you do this without ""repressed memories therapy"" like is there any prompt I can ask myself that could help me wrap my head around it? I do not really want to elaborate on it but I think my bad memories from when i was a bit younger that i have repressed my whole life are the root of all the mental health issues I have today, and I cannot move past them until I return to my past for a bit. And also I think that because I am in this habit of repressing everything, it may be why I cannot remember anything that has happned to me the day before because I regret all of my social interactions so I try and block yhem out and pretend they never happened but I talk a lot so I end up forgetting my whole day. Like I am starting to forget everything and I want a good memory (mehaving a bad memory might not have to do with repressed memories but I am staying open to the possibility). Ik this post is not exactly about depression but I do not know where else to get help for this (google has not helped me) other than this subreddit. Also I think repressed memories are something that causes an issue for a lot of people in the community so an answer to these questions may be beneficial to other people here.

19676,"Thinking back, my life was always disaster. I lost my dad when I was young, being raise up by mom who struggled with terrible depression and anxiety and her own abusive mother, constantly thinking what the hell I am doing in this world. I remember thinking that I will give anything for my life being just slightly better - not fine, not in order, just a little light in the dark. Years passed and I am in much better point that I ever was - I managed to step back from most of my shitty family, managed to have some career (it is really nothing at all but it is something to keep me far away from poverty and that is really more than enough), even have a girlfriend which is weird because I hate intimacy (actually I am pretty sure I am asexual but that is another thing) but she is has its own problems and we somehow could balance everything and move on. I think? Looks pretty good? Well, maybe. Thing is, I am a black hole, big fucking black hole that is just sucking up everything positive that is coming to me and turn it into vapor. Back in my ""horrible"" days I could cry, scream and put some video game or series on and managed to put my brain into escape-mode. I cannot do that anymore. Nothing, nothing in the slightest gives me joy, everything that comes from mouths of other people is just mumble for me, I do not fucking care about nearly anything. I care about my girlfriend but it takes 9.0 magnitude brain quake to do slightest thing and I am so tired after anything that I wish I could take a brake for this world for a month (or eternity).I was trying to convince myself that I am just in bad luck. Maybe my job is just fucking mess (and ones before that too, how convenient) etc, one day I will change it and everything will be fine. Well, nope. it is just downward spiral. I cannot find way back.

Met a girl and starting dating her, we talked nonstop and loved eachother, got bored and lost feelings after 5 months.3. Started reading books, would read entire books in just a few days, now I can barely pick one up. The only things that I can think of that I do not get bored of are stocks, cars, and business (my passions), but then again, it is always a different stock, different car, and different idea to make money.My father is similar but I think my case is more severe. I cannot see myself dating/marrying for longer than 2 years, being at a job for more than 2 years, etc. I would say my mind is definitely different compared to most people.

48845,"How do I get better? I am 18, from Brazil, currently doing architecture. I have depression and anxiety, probably ADHD too, but still need to do the tests again. I was taking medication since mamy years ago. Got discharged at the begging of the year before starting college, had to get back at it again after starting the course. I took the same meds as before which I used for years, but my body didn't understand that I have already took then before and had some side effects that scared me and I stopped taking one of the meds. Then after the end of my 1st semester I was looking worse with my depression, so my psychiatrist decided to give me adult depression meds... safe to say it backfire extraordinarily, I just turned 18, barely a month ago. 

Went to other doctors and and the 1st side effect went away, but the adult medication gave me more and worse side effects, so again me psychiatrist suggested changing meds. My mom already had some bad impressions on the doctor so after they tried to change again with no wait to see if I'd get better, she told me to stop taking any meds altogether.

I get why, my appetite is lower than usual and I am super sensible to climate and temperature, my intestines are hurting and my head aches everyday. So I am currently on the process of adapting. And a new college period stared when I was told to change meds for the 2nd time... I am barely keeping up again with whats being teached and although I got the handle of how college works, I am suffering. Stuff that usually don't bother me or gove me so much work are really demanding me. I am not taking notes as I'd like or being able to concentrate in almost any task that is mildly difficult.

47713,"Why accepting and even embracing my depression has actually helped me. Let me start that I used to feel shame and embarrassment about my depression. I used to hate myself and feel like a freak, and that nobody else ever went through the feelings I did. I was terrified of people finding out I suffered from depression, like it would make them think less of me and that I should be avoided and pitied. 

At some point, I had a certain epiphany, if you will. I concluded that depression is a normal thing that affects everyone. I have a feeling anyone who says they never get depressed isn’t being honest, or just afraid of judgement. Everyone gets depressed, and it shouldn’t be anything to be ashamed about.

I’m aware that, although everyone experiences depression, it doesn’t affect everyone the same. Some people, such as myself, have closed themselves off to people and made themselves a victim of this idea that they should feel ashamed of their depression and hide it from everyone, lest they be judged and ridiculed for it. 

But not me, not anymore at least. I think depression should be normalized, or at the very least accepted. People shouldn’t be made to believe they’re broken and need to be fixed. Depression isn’t something that needs to be “fixed”, it’s something that needs to be understood. The truth is, my depression isn’t going to just go away. It’s a natural, human emotion. It’s a part of the human condition, and only someone completely devoid of emotion would never go through it. 

I get it, it sucks to go through it. I know all to well, and can’t tell you how many times I just wanted to die. But i don’t regret my depression, because I believe it gives my more humility. I believe that by being more open and accepting of my depression, I can open up to others going through those painful, difficult times. I can show them that even though depression may never go away for good, there are ways to manage it healthily and effectively. I think it just starts by learning to understand and accept depression as a normal, human emotion that everyone goes through. Don’t ever think you’re the only one or that you have it worse than everyone else. If I could do it, you should be able to, too.",Depression

21492,"Sorry I do not know if this qualifies as request personal support but please let me know if anything is wrong. I have had severe acne for the last 2 (almost 3) years now. By this I mean I had large, inflamed blind pimples over my face. It just started when I was 14 and got worse and worse. I looked absolutely disgusting and the pain was even worse than the looks people gave me. I went from doctor to doctor but all they did was give me generic medication that did nothing. I eventually went to a dermatologist and all he did was inject my face with this stuff that was supposed to help but it just made it hurt more. I had these medications which were supposed to be strong but just made me extremely depressed, more than I already was. The cherry on top is I moved into homeschooling and the people I thought were my friends just never messaged me to ask where I was or what happened. Idk maybe its selfish of me to think that. My acne has gotten a lot better recently however I still have scarring and I occasionally will get the large ones.

After all, if I have nothing to fall back on, then I will just attempt again naturally and one of those will be my last.When I try thinking about actually killing myself, a million thoughts run my mind. What happens after? Where do we go? What will my family think? Especially the uncertainty after death, is keeping me alive. Maybe we reincarnate, and maybe I will end up luckier than this life. I am supposed to live until 80, yet how am I to survive that long if I cannot even think about living to see adulthood? 4 years until I turn 18, but everyday feels like an entire lifetime of pain, I am supposed to live 66 more years of this?None of it feels worth it, I have become so lethargic that getting out of bed to eat has become a hard task. Nothing feels necessary, at least for my life. Even if I had some kind of prophecy to fill, what do I receive, what is the point? Is it the journey, could it be salvation? Because if this is the path they gave me, it better be some heavenly reward.Sometimes I wish I could not have the power to reason, to think. But I think the life of an animal to be even more monotonous and bland than my own. So I am stuck between being able to reason and think about my thoughts, but having a vivid and unique life; and having an almost mindless and empty life. Though that does not mean an animal would care, they just do what they are meant to, survive. Sometimes that is what I wish I can do, like at a flick of a switch. Isolate and live as if I were only living to live and survive, not having to think. Unfortunately, that is not a life society sees to be useful or productive, so I hope to be reborn as an animal of the sea. While it does not matter what I think now, I would like to be born as a dolphin as opposed to a lion, the ocean is vastly mysterious and unexplored; land is mostly explored and uninteresting(to me).My death will probably be a while away, but it brings me peace to plan and prepare for when the day comes.

Been in therapy for 7/8 years, meds for 6, tried 5-6 different meds and they have worked with varying degrees of success. I started a job I really like two years ago. My depression has been getting steadily worse since...Marchish? In April, I received a written warning about my performance (forgetting things, missing meetings, etc). It got to the point that I spent most of June in a disassociate haze that culminated in going to the psych ward for 5 days (june 30-July 5) because I tried to kill myself. I was off for 5 work days. Two days after I came back from FMLA leave, I was given a final written warning for my performance, with all of the listed incidents happening the last two weeks of June. The ultimate kick in the crotch was the writeup was dated and supposed to be given to me the day I went to the hospital. I feel absolutely lost and confused. My supervisors know I was in the hospital, my immediate boss knows off the record why I was in the hospital, but I feel like I am being unfairly treated. I feel like, if I came back and told them I had cancer, they would not have written me up. Getting the writeup basically reset all the progress I had made in the hospital and I feel hopeless.

I live with my parents. I cannot work at all and my disability claim was denied. I sent it in an appeal, hoping for the best. Its always hard being around my father. It seems like hes so disappointed in me and it creates a very tense atmosphere. Its easier to be around my mom but its still hard. My older brother blew up at me a few weeks ago telling me how lazy I am. He does not believe I have a disability. He was incredibly insulting. I blocked him but he apologized so I am talking to him again. Hopefully it will stay civil. My younger brother is nice but does not really understand my situation. I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor, protocol after protocol.

I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life.

24115,"This is a lot, and a long story, the past 3 months have been so hard and I do not know how to deal. This is a vent but also just trying to have someone understand what I have been through I guess. I have dealt with depression (along with OCD and GAD) my entire life, I have self-helped for a decade and started dealing with it more seriously 3 years ago going to therapy. Life has taken a big turn in the past year and I am having trouble processing. Obviously Covid has been a big thing, lost my favourite job bartending at a music venue which was something I was super passionate about and loved. I made a big move to try and start fresh. I was having health issues and while not pinpointing what was wrong with me I was told I may be infertile, which was a lot. Bought an AMC and started working on it as a project while I was not working and that brought me joy. Then while dealing with my health, found out I was pregnant. Bam. was not sure what to do, and I just could not go through with a procedure, and although hopeful made sure I made the decision knowing I might be alone in doing it. My sister was extremely supportive. I found a good job, got promoted and found a new roommate who was super excited about living with a baby as my roommate at the time was not sure and that was totally fair. I did everything I could to secure our future. My roommates parents bought a place for rental income and investment, I painted 2 rooms 8 months pregnant because it was not freshly painted or new. Made the place my own, set it up beautifully before baby was here. Spent my savings on new furniture and everything the baby could need. Everything was looking pretty bright, and then I started labour. It went on for 84 hours of active labour, I had absolutely terrible care in the hospital, my epidural failed, the first doctor dealing with me did not tell me anything or helped, and on the 83.5 hour a female obstetrician knew I would needed a C-section LONG ago. It was so traumatic, and I am so happy he made it here healthy and happy. I hated being in the hospital and I left as soon as they let me, I was sleep deprived and not sane to leave, let alone physically capable after that surgery. When I got home I had no help, I could not move, and I felt so helpless. My new roommate left the place a mess while I was in the hospital and I was not okay. Found out my mom relapsed for the first time in many many years after she did not come help me and left me alone in my bed crying for 8 hours, and acting very strange. My roommate ended up being a piece of shit, and told me to leave 2 weeks after my surgery where I could not walk because I was pushing myself cleaning up after her, and doing everything myself because she needed a break. I had to travel and push myself even further. My sister who was previously so supportive abandoned me. I was totally alone. When I came back home, my roommate put all this dangerous ant killer dust everywhere on every window sill, wall, ledge, and was spraying Raid in the air like air freshener because of a few ants, that I never even saw. She would not clean it up even though it is dangerous to breathe in for an adult let alone a newborn. She then proceeded to spray Raid outside my room at 3am, knocking on my door to show me one ant at 3am to try and prove she was in the right. I had to give my month notice as she would not clean it up. I could not live like that. I left again, it was not safe for me to be there, my breathing and coughing was insane. I had pushed myself so hard that I started bleeding terribly, got an insane fever and had to go to the hospital alone. It was a week after my 1 month notice and I was just going to clean up the ant dust myself so I could pack my things etc. But when I got home every single item I owned was put on my bed, on the floor of my room and it was completely uninhabitable. My dishes, every single last item in storage, in the living room, groceries, laundry room etc. I had a full blown meltdown and just asked her how she could do this to a new mom, a single mother at that, she begged me for forgiveness, said she was so sorry about everything she put me through and since I could not live there that she would give my rent back. I packed everything and put it into storage, moving truck, and supplies it all cost me so much. She played nice and asked me what she could do etc. As soon as I was gone she and her parents (landlords) blocked me and denied my promised rent back. Legally because I had given my notice, I cannot do anything. So I have been couch surfing with a newborn for 2 months. My dad's gf has ALS and he suggested we find a place together so I could save some money, now I am caretaking a newborn and her. With all this stress and instability my anxiety is through the roof, my OCD back tenfold, and I feel like an absolute failure for my son. All his clothes in storage outgrew, all the new things I bought with my savings a waste. Just living out of bags. Then I had an extremely painful gallbladder attack as a cherry on top. Because storage is in another city I still do not have my things and will not even be able to fit it in the new tiny place, just a small room for me and my son. it is just too fucking much. I feel so ostracized and alone because of Covid, just being a parent and not able to do anything, I have been sober because I am breastfeeding so cannot even cope unhealthily for even a night. I cannot afford therapy, I do not have any real help. My doctor think my depression and anxiety are fine because my baby is healthy so it cannot be that bad. I do not know where to start. I love him so fucking much, and he is my world but I feel like I have not even been able to just enjoy being a mother and I feel so fucking robbed of the experience I know it should have and could have been. If I did not have him, I know I would not be here today. I am tired of being strong, I do not feel strong. I cannot stop crying, I am exhausted, I am hurt. Thank you if you read this all, and I do not know what I am expecting but I am not doing okay. I have always dealt with depression fairly well but life keeps throwing so much more and I do not know how to handle it",Depression

35094,"How much to say when speaking with your doctor So I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow, which I have probably been putting off for too long (I feel like the more I see her, the less seriously she will take me).  I have symptoms that have lasted months (or in some cases years, only they've gotten worse), ones that have lasted weeks, and one that just started a few days ago.  When I scheduled the appointment, I listed the three most worrisome or annoying symptoms as the reason for going in.  My question is just... when I actually go to my appointment, should I read the dr my laundry list of symptoms, or should I just address what I scheduled the appointment for?  What do you do when you have many different symptoms?  I know that people can have multiple illnesses at once, but the fact that my symptoms are in a few different, probably unrelated areas makes me worry that my dr will just assume that *everything* is in my head (and yes, I'm aware that much of it could be all in my head).  I'm also worried that if I mention that all this feeling ill exacerbates my anxiety and that my anxiety exacerbates my feeling ill that she'll write me off as a nut case.

Tl;dr- I'm experiencing a lot of probably unrelated symptoms.  When I see my doctor, should I tell her ALL the symptoms I'm experiencing (and risk being taken less seriously), or just the most concerning ones?  What do you do?

34682,"Is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? My life has been a big mess since August. A dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. I suspected MS - did an MRI, an SSEP - they found nothing. Then, I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety, and still I kept thinking the opposite.

In January I woke up with my right side tingling/pins and needles, followed by a toothache. Of course, I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia - a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.

I had a cavity, did a root canal, the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations - eyelid, eyelashes, inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is, but it's really uncomfortable.

I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this, they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know, I can't find peace, I'm always startled, nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. 

I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this, or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. One thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned down/disappears when I'm distracted. But it hits me again when I'm alone at home working, for instance.

I felt desperate, sad, angry... My mom does not have an easy life : in 2019 she lost like 70% of her left feet capacity and had to undergo two back surgeries. She has to take morphine everyday to fight the pain but she is still in pain. My mom was a very active woman and the fact that she cannot run, jump, or even walk properly makes her really depressed. She also has financial issues because her salary is trash and she is working a dead end job that she hates. My father is not really helpful and she thinks hes not in love with her anymore, my dog whom she loved dearly passed away in April and I am moving away in September.

Nobody knows about this, not even my parents know how bad it is. About 2 years ago, I found something on my vulva which looked unfamiliar. I had to go to the hospital to check it. It turns out that I had 2 cysts on my clitoral hood skin, and they had to be removed because of possible malignancy. The surgeries did not go well. First I was quite shocked, because it looked a bit different, but I might could have lived with it still. But then, around 5 months after the surgery and when the doctors also told me that everything healed well now, I got a random scar infection out of the blue. Now I have a quite significant scar on the right side on my clitoral hood. My labia minora and clitoris were left intact but because of this, I cry everyday. The whole experience was so traumatic I got pretty severe PTSD. I cannot even talk to a psychologist about it. People on dating apps have called me pretty and what not, but I always backed off when they asked for a date because I thought its senseless anyways. I do not want to tell my story to everyone I get intimate with since its pretty traumatic, and who is still going to like me with all these scars?

51929,"I’m dating someone I really like and it’s absolutely killing me A bit of background: I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. 

I’m 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. I’ve dated a lot over the past few years, but this is the first time in ages where I’ve REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them, and anxiety doesn’t play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed, and I’m getting crushed. 

Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me, obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning, freaking out if she’s doesn’t respond to my messages within a couple hours. It’s taking over my life. My work is slipping, I can’t sleep well, a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

It doesn’t help that she’s very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I don’t want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface I’ve been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on, because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.

I don’t know what to do.",Anxiety
11648,"I do not even know why I am writing this but i need to get this off my chest. I am 21, about to graduate college with very good grades, already have a decent job where everyone seems vey nice and helpful. I have very loving family, i have friends who i talk to almost every day but still even after everything i have i feel empty. I just do not want to exist anymore.it is not that I am sad but that I just can not imagine myself living. I have not tried anything yet but i do not trust myself. I try to keep myself as distracted as possible to stop thinking about it but the moment I am unoccupied I just start thinking about it. I even imagine what the people around me will be like after i die. I do not know when it started exactly but I have been feeling like this for years. In my first year of college i found myself staring down the stairwell ready to just let gravity do the work, then I had a accident in my 2nd year and the only thing i remember feeling during that was relief. I try to live by bargaining for time with my thoughts. I say to myself let us just try living for a week to watch the new episode of a show or let us just wait for that movie to release, or let us just wait until I have visited that place but it is not working anymore. I try thinking that my mom will be sad, my little brother would miss me or my dad will be hurt, but then i think they will get over it after a few years. I have to die someday let us just get it over with. I do not even know why I am like this. I have not told this to anyone. I tried talking to my mom last week but could not. I do not know what to do. I do not know how long i can stop myself. I do not even know why i want to do this. I have not felt happy in la long while, every time i feel happy the emptiness just comes back after a while. Every night i go to sleep dreading waking up in morning. Even now its almost 3 in the morning and i do not want to sleep even though I am tired. I do not know how much longer i can hold out like this. I do not know why I am writing this, i just want to stop. I want to be happy for once, without the permanent anxiety and fear. I want to wake up feeling happy, i do not want to be empty. I want to love someone, anyone. I want to be happy but i feel like i will never be. Please i do not know wat to do i just want to cry but I cannot even do that now. I want to do something i like but i do not like anything. I do not know what i want anymore.

I just came to realize how numb I feel today. For some contest I (24F) have been struggling  mentally pretty much since childhood.I've had low self-confidence,anxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as I can remember. Life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually don't last more than a couple of days so I guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now I'm almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at 3am.
I've been aware of this for a while, but the sheer extent of how tired I am and how I don't care about anything anymore hit me today when I found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning I will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing. The tought of that used to scare me, but now I just don't care that much . I am so lost on how to improve but at the same time I don't have the desire to do anything about it. All I wanna do is sleep and not wake up I wish time would just stop. I don't know why I'm writing this for some advice maybe ?or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy.",Depression

48149,"Hopeless and want Hope I do not know where to begin. I found out my mom has stage 2 lung cancer and we have a complicated relationship. I love her but I do not like her as a person. She was very controlling, toxic and rough. I know she had the best intentions for me but she used shame to inspire me to be what she wanted. She helped to make me a people pleaser and obsessed with my weight. I do not hate her. I love her. I hate that I am not the daughter she wanted. She is trying to be kind now but it does not come naturally to her.

I try to visit my folks every 2 months to help out as I am several states away. I am very sad as when my folks pass, they are both in their 80’s, I will not have any family of origin. 

I get sad thinking about attending a funeral. It is not sadness. It is deeper. I do not think I would be able to get on a plane. I think about this  as my mom has let me know that I have to. I told her that I do not care what other people think. That is a lie. I do care deeply what others think.

I am crying right now. It is more than my mom being sick. I grew up being told I was fat and told that everyone was talking about me. I know she just wanted a thin daughter and did not have the tools to tell me she would love me just as I am but was concerned about my health. She would just use guilt and shame to make me feel bad. I think she wanted to inspire me with these tactics. She and my dad both had rough childhoods and did not know how to parent. They sent me to good schools, bought me everything I wanted and tried their best with the limited knowledge they had. 

Still crying and feeling hopeless. I feel that my life has been so much to please them. And I failed according to them. They are both trying very hard to be loving now. I did not receive hugs growing up and do now. 

I am rambling. I just am very sensitive. I think my self esteem is so low that I do not know how to receive love now. 
Please tell me if you had a complex relationship with a parent and how you handled end of life issues. How did you cope with a dying parent who made you feel like a failure ?
How do you go on after being told how terrible you are?
Why was she so rough?
Why did it take her finding out she has cancer to hug me and tell me I look good?
Why?
Will I find happiness after she dies?
Why do I hate myself?

But everything fell through when I entered high school... My classmates either did not like me or just did not talk to me. I ended up getting isolated. The teachers there were mean... most of them. There were some that saw that I was struggling so they took care of me in some way... but it was not enough. I started hating my life, hating myself, and my grades started dropping until I ended up getting the lowest grades in my class. My parents were disappointed in me... I ended up losing my friends since I would stay most days in the house and the ones that stayed are not truly good friends.The thing is last year I had to take an important exam so I could enter my preferred university, but I did not make it in. I was so depressed that I could not study the material needed so I could get in, even though at some point in my life I loved to study these subjects. Depression made me unmotivated to study. Before I entered high school I also loved drawing, but now I do not. All I want is to stay and do nothing forever. After I failed my entrance exam I convinced my parents to stay a year home and study for the exam next year. Well... I stayed a year and did mostly nothing.

49783,"Diagnosed, but having doubts I'd like to preface first by saying that I'm not American.

I've been diagnosed bipolar II a few year ago during while in a psych ward. During all the years I've been seeing psychiatrists, it was brought up only once by a psychiatrist I've seen for less than a month. I've been somewhat successfully treated with seroquel. 

While I thought I had BP before my diagnosis,  this diagnosis as almost always made very little sense to me. I do have some pretty extreme mood swings, but far more than 4-5  a year and they sometimes last only hours.

The psychiatrist who followed me years never brought it up. He didn't change my meds, didn't really take any interest in my symptoms. He was pretty much happy just continuing the traitement that was prescribed to me during my trip to the psych ward. Last therapist didn't seem to believe I had any illness.

I'm seeing any therapists or psychiatrists anymore and I have stopped my meds. So far, I'm doing alright. 

I would like to know if any of you have experienced very frequent mood swings (say in the range of 50 a year) and very short episode, because I find really hard to relate to other people with bipolar disorder.",Bipolar

I went from making a great salary last year to not being able to sleep this year when my company was bought, which led to a whole host of sleeping medications....trazadone, ativan, ambien, xyprexa, coupled with propanerol to reduce heart rate. Then I had the worst 30 day headache of my life. I started SSRIs/SNRIs...celexa (had a horrible reaction to this and had to stop). My genetic test revealed I metabolize medications well but I am predisposed to side effects. I went on to cymbalta, and now I am on lexapro. My initial trigger was 2-3 hours of sleep over a 15 day period, and then I had the awesome experience of 45 days straight locked in fight or flight mode. In some ways, I am surprised I have survived this. Prior to this episode, I took like one Advil every 10 years....the desperation was and still is real. I am dizzy and weak, I have lost a great deal of my memory, which was photographic, and my mental acuity and sharpness is slow as fuck compared to who I used to be. I was witty and humorous and showed a great deal of support for other people, and now I only care about how shitty I feel and how no one can relate (you guys probably can). I barely talk to anyone including my wife, because I literally do not know what to say. I have been in intensive outpatient therapy, regular talk therapy and all these meds that are not working and make me feel like shit. I have an awesome friend group and wife, I was successful and own a home, I was talented and driven. I barely know what day it is and there is certainly no way I can work right now. I would love to get back to work and life, but I am not in control of this right now. The pain from this is much much more than just being sad. it is the loss of self, your mental and physical abilities and the anxiety that comes from when will this end? and will I ever be who I used to be? that makes this truly terrifying. To top it all off, there is no relief--it is not like you can pop a cough drop for a sore throat that buys you 15 mins of some relief, depression is every excruciating second of the day. You walk around with an imaginary 200lb ball and chain on your leg that only you can feel. You are not interested in anything, you can barely have sex if at all, and you do not even know who you are or what you have become. I feel like since March, I am only a heart and lung machine, with nothing going on up above. If only depression was just being sad. It took me 40 mins to write these incoherent paragraphs that look wildly different than how I used to write. The reminders are literally everywhere in everything you do that you are not you.

You try to have a real interest and love for things in this world, but it is not coming naturally. Due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about. Moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adult's body. Constantly thinking about self presentation and body language, always knowing that it is your outward presentation that largely impacts your opportunities in life.

And at the end of the work day you come home. You are exaughsted, but your job doesn't pay well. So you are supposed to use the time after work to study and work towards a better future. But you feel beaten down and tired when you get home. You can barely muster the energy to work out. If you do, it takes forever because you are tired and you can't focus. And if you are me, a day spent among the socially competent and likable is enough to send you into a negative thought spiral. Googling about how to improve social skills, feeling tired when you read about what you have to do. You are already tired. It is a compounding tiredness. You know it isn't your sleep or your diet. Both of those are in check. It's just life. A life that you are having trouble with feeling enthusiastic about in the first place.

Every day, the nagging thought that you will always be alone is ever present in the back of your mind. You can't stop thinking about those women who you did not have a choice but be attracted to romantically. Not in a very heavy way. They were just someone you actually wanted to shoot your shot with. And you know you failed with these women. And during the time you knew them, you sat and watched as the aforementioned likable, charismatic men of the world easily swooned them, entertained them, freely loved them, and their love was accepted. And you look at that and see that you are not like them. You will never be like those men. You can try every day to painstakingly get there.

You can try as hard as you can to relax and be a fun person to be around, but you never quite reach that state of being. You often wonder if you are not mentally/cognitively capable of being like those men. And you realize that all of this is making you tired still. In addition to feeling essentially doomed to be alone in this world, you are confronted with it's relentless challenges, and you wonder, what is the point of it all? Is this life worth living? Is there a reason to smile when you are the kind of person that you are in this world, and you can't seem to really change despite your absolute best effort, which you painstakingly put in every day, only to return to the same sad, tired state at the end of the day? It's difficult to get excited for life, when you feel socially incapable and generally unlovable. When you feel unable to bring value to other people as a friend, as a companion.

Another day wasted. A day of work is to be followed by a day of work towards a better life, for which there doesn't seem to be any energy. My mind is tortured with the thought that I am not fundamentally a good enough person to be with. This thought never goes away. I will always be alone.",Depression

I am not sleeping or eating, I am working 24/7 and my body is collapsing slowly. But I could not care less. I need to find some help because I do not think I can resist for long. So, i know this girl since 2015 ish and we fell in love with each other really fast. I am the kind of guy that have that really old mentality where I can only love once. I can still have relationships but I never really loved someone that much. She quickly became my everything and I could not live without her. long story short, I did everything to make her happy and I worked hard for a future together. I promised to myself that this girl, will be the woman that will raise our children with me. I decided that she must be the only girl of my life, no matter what. and then Covid happened. we could not see each other for 6 months because she is nearby my general location but was in another region. So we had to restart after all of this time lost but we had a lot of fights instead and things were not going that well. Then, the worse happened. she was not sure about our relationship because we could not see each other for a lot of time but she told me to remain calm since she still had feeling for me so we will be together again soon. but I am not done yet. while we were in a pause, she met a guy. she was honest with me, I do not hate her. but the sentence changed. we will not be again together. if only we resisted like till her birthday ( a week later ) that me and her family decided to surprise her... we could have been together for like two weeks at least. but no. now she invited that guy, and her family is really sad and worried about me since they became mine family too. and now I am all alone. I still love her so much, I constantly cry about it and I am starting to let my life go. I cannot do a thing bc everything reminds me of her, we did so much together. idk, I do not want to move forward, I just cannot without her. and it is killing me the fact that another guy, even if a friend still, can be with her. but soon they will be together if things go well and I do not want to ever see that day. I am looking for help because a part of me thinks that life matter, the other half just wants to die. idk even know, I am so confused, I cannot explain how depressed I feel, I think about suicide too, I want to stop suffering. thanks a lot for your time, it means a lot to me, I hope the best for each one of you.. it is unbelievable how a single girl could change my life... for ever. plot twist: in a really bad way...",Depression

While I was drafted, I dind't mention that I am serverly depressed for years now. I already had a failed suicide attempt 4 years ago. By not mentioning this at the drafting, I was able to go to the infantry and I planed to stay in it for about 2 years to finance my university degree.

Twice already my comerades had to do sit ups because of me, but I also do not want to leave, for I do not know another way of earning money right now.My depression makes me panic in fear of fking up, everytime I have to do a task. This makes it impossible for me to do even the easiest tasks. All this pressiure and this feeling of dissapionting my squad, makes me cry myself into sleep nearly every night. I always hate myself for not being able to get myself together and always regarded myself as a failure. I also do not want to be that guy, that left his service. I cannot do it anymore. Since Switzerlands gunlaws are just to easy, I already own a handgun, and in the last six days, the only thing I tought about is to use it for me, so I will not be the failure that quit his service. The problem is, I live at home, I have three siblings and I do not want them to find me. I also hate the thought of hurting my family, my friends, my girlfriend and all the people close to me. I really have no idea on what to do. I cannot carry on, I do not want to hurt anyone, yet all I want is to end this 6 year long suffering. I already dreamed every day to end it all, but up until now, I always had a reason to carry on. As it is may not clear by with this text, I really wanted to go in the military, but now I realised, that I suck at the one thing that made me go through this until now. I do not know how to carry on, it is just to much. I also do not know if I will still be around by Monday in a week. All I know is that I want to end it. Since years I expected nothing from my life, and the fear of becoming the failure I already think I am, makes me want to end it even more. Sorry for posting such a long text.

46356,"I feel like bipolar is ignored. Anyone know any good mental health nonprofits that actually support bipolar? I've liked TWLOHA since I was in high school because of their dedication to preventing suicide and they were really connected to the music scene I was into, but now as I'm older and diagnosed, I'll listen to their podcasts and watch their social media and there's nothing that ever acknowledges bipolar. Just depression and anxiety. I feel like most organizations are this way. They support anxiety and depression because they're the trendy things to support while things like bipolar, borderline and schizophrenia are still too scary and inappropriate to mention. I'd really like to see an organization that recognizes bipolar and supports more mental illnesses than just depression and anxiety. Anyone know of any good ones? In the US, so ones available in the US preferred.",Bipolar

17566,"Hi, I am F29. I do not know where to begin and how to describe my situation. My brain is a bit foggy and the whole text will be a mess, but i hope you bear with me. Today I finally faced my fears and decided to seek help for anxiety, depression and work related burn out. I am absolutely terrified and i wish to get some kind of support. I feel like i am a failure, weak person or somehow just bad. I am scared of how my work community will react to me probably taking a few months of sick leave because i cannot handle the pressure and stress anymore. I am scared of getting a stigma of being lazy or untrustworthy. I am scared i will never be trusted again. I feel disappointed in myself. I feel like I am unfit for the society and somehow i will never be able to live a normal life.I have been more or less depressed for the past 2 years. I have a history with depression, eating disorders and anxiety as long as i can remember (long story short, i grew up in a very toxic family and because of that i cut all ties to my mother 10 years ago). In my life there has been multiple crisis that has affected me, but this time it was actually different than before (past crisis were due to abusive people around / toxic relationships.)&amp;#x200B;What lead me here this time: It all pretty much started when I started my studies in uni. I had to move 300 km away from my significant other and all my closest friends. I left everything i knew behind and stepped into the unknown. It was mentally exhausting. Somehow i survived the first 2 years of uni but i reached a breaking point during the 3rd year. I decided to take 1,5 years worth of courses in 6 months just so that i will graduate faster and get home faster. It all backfired on me and i just burned out completely. I just left my studies and moved back home, decided to put uni on hold and wait to get better. That was 2 years ago and i have not been able to even think about my studies ever since.I study economics and business administration and I had already agreed for a summer job in business finances before I actually moved back home. So the plan was to rest for a few months and just go to work for a few months and see how i feel about studying after the summer. I was doing extremely well with my job and they decided to give me a permanent position. I took it because 1. i really needed the money and 2. i felt like i was not ready to return to my studies.This is where it all started going wrong. First mentally exhausting thing that really hit me hard was sexual harassment from my coworker. One night he got really drunk at a company party and was just really all over me. I froze completely. He said the most nasty, vile things to me and I just stood there, not knowing what to do (i was not drunk). The whole event is something i still cannot even think about. The person makes me sick and I just feel sick and I feel like i physically can not go back to that night in my head. I could have reported him (he had a history of sexual harassment reports) but i felt like it was my fault. I started to suffer from panic attacks before work, i felt guilty about it. I felt dirty and unworthy. He continued to harass me even when he was sober. And every day at work i just pretended nothing ever happened, while i felt completely broken on the inside. After some months, i decided i need to leave that environment and i applied for a new job within the same organization. I never really told anyone what happened or dealt with it, i just pushed the whole thing aside in my head and decided to move on. I got the job i applied for and it was actually something really interesting. 200% better than what i had before. I thought it will be the beginning of something good, for the first time in my life i actually had a job that i enjoyed, that i was actually really damn good at and that felt ""right"" every day. Looking back at it, i feel like eventhough all of this is true, i was not really ready to take on new challenges and the previous events were still at the back of my head like an open wound.The new department i joined is relatively new and tbh, nobody knew shit there. The amount of people working in that department went from 15 (when i started) to 60 within 1 year. It was, and still is, blatantly obvious that I was one of the most professional and capable person there. So they started to give me the most difficult projects. They put me in charge of developing new processes and basically teaching all the new people what to do and how to do it. I loved the topic so i never said no. The shit just kept piling and piling. More things to do, more projects, more this, more that. I told my supervisor it is getting out of control. That I am drowning. I do not have enough time in my day to do all of this. He is a cool dude so he decided to give me a promotion and a team of 5 people so i can give them some of the stuff. The problem is, these 6 people that are now in my team are new workers, and the stuff i do requires a lot of knowledge on the topic. So now i am basically teaching them everything i know AND doing all the stuff i was doing before AND all the new stuff that keeps coming weekly.I have not slept since November. I do not go out. I do not answer when my phone rings and my friends call, because i feel like i am just too tired to even talk. I do not want to see anyone. I am angry, frustrated. All the stuff that i kept inside my head is now coming out. I have not had my period in 8 months. I gained 7 kg in half a year because i am too tired to cook food so i just order unhealthy food at home. Yesterday i had a complete melt down at work due to the frustration of not being able to read an email, because i cannot focus on anything anymore. I did not sleep all night and woke up just crying hysterically. I finally went and saw a doctor today and the diagnosis is anxiety, depression and burn out. I am seeing another one next week as well as a psychologist. it is going to be a long sick leave by the looks of it. By nature i am a perfectionist, over achiever, I set my goals super high and my standards for my work even higher. I do not know who I am trying to impress, or if I am just trying to prove my self worth by being a super human. But i feel like i disappointed myself and everyone around me. I feel like I am being unfair towards others if i take time off. I am scared shitless of being seen as weak by everyone around me. And i am so angry because i did not meet my own expectations. This is my first day of sick leave and i am already terrified of going back to work and seeing everyone. I do not know how to handle my fears, the anger, the sadness and being so god damn tired that even emptying the dish washer sounds like too difficult of a task to complete. Today i decided to seek help and it scares me",Depression

46026,"Lurker realizing I need some help coping/understanding depressive episode relapse. I guess for some preface I was diagnosed last year but have had it all my life. I'm type 1 but was pretty functional as I typically used what I now realize is my mania in school and etc. and pretty much was excelling despite going through manic and depressive episodes (thinking it was normal/teenage angst etc.) until about my 4th year in college when things went down south fast. Fast forward two years, a couple of hospital visits, and finally getting a full wrap around team, I'm a lot more stable now that I'm on what I feel are the right set of meds for me atm (been on a set of lithium, lorazepram, and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly). It's allowed me to work, write, and just generally focus like I used to without the mood swings and recognize when I'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that I'm used to. I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens, but recently have had a string of events (good, bad, and otherwise) have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this, which is a huge step compared to before, but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I  know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system, but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. Because I'm really in a spot where Im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflix/movie suggestions as I don't have much energy to do anything else.

34475,"Ridiculously anxious about my teeth it’s making me miserable. Hi everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve had health anxiety for around 3 years now but have only just joined reddit and thought I’d search to see if such a subreddit exists and it does. 

So yeah, I’ve had HA for 3 years. It was severely bad 3 years ago, I had a lot of stress going on but I managed to get it under control. I used to be so bad, any pain or symptom I panicked and I can’t even count the amount of times I called 999 or 111 (I’m in the UK) and had ambulances come out for me. I was at the doctors almost 3 times a week. 

Everything has been fine until recently, under a lot of stress again. A lot of uncertainty in my life and may have to uproot and leave my home (for like the 15th time in the past 3 years). Ever since the stress, the HA has crept back in. Right now, I’m petrified and convinced that I’m going to lose my two front teeth. 

I haven’t been to see a dentist in the last 5 years since they gave me 2 fillings and I had such excruciating pain afterwards for a few months whenever I drank or ate something too hot or cold I had awful pain up the side of my face. Something as simple as changing my tooth paste fixed it and I haven’t had it since. But I haven’t been in 5 years and I think that itself is what scares me. I’m not even registered at a dentist, I’m going to call round tomorrow morning to register. 

My problem is, I am convinced that my 2 front teeth wobble. Well not wobble, but they definitely move if I hold onto the tooth with my thumb and index finger and try to move each tooth. I can ever see it in the mirror (I think). It’s only slight and it’s not wobbling or twisting or anything like that. But that’s enough to have convinced me that I’m doomed and my teeth will fall out.  I smoke so I think that’s contributing to the fear. Plus I suffer from depression so I haven’t brushed as often as I should because I neglect myself. 

Has anyone else had any similar issues in relation to anxiety about their teeth? Are teeth supposed to move if you try to move them with your fingers? I did a google search (awful I know, I promised myself I would stop doing this) and all the results were about gum disease or forums where people put as the header ‘I lost my front teeth!’ So that’s terrified me even more. 

My gums seem fine, they don’t hurt, they aren’t red. They bleed when I brush sometimes but that’s when im really rough at brushing. If I’m gentle and brush properly, no blood. I’m so terrified I’m already acting like they’ve fallen out. Ive even been thinking that I wish they would just fall out at least then I could be like okay, so now I need to get this sorted. But the whole worrying that it might happen is a nightmare. I’ve been spending the past week either crying uncontrollably or sleeping so I don’t have to think about it. That is of course unless I have a dream where my teeth fall out which I dream about quite frequently. 

Sorry that this is so long. I’ve never really spoken about my HA before. Nobody ever seemed to get it and my doctor is in no way supportive or understanding, just acts like I’m annoying them. My family don’t get it either. My mum actually told me I was deranged when I was in the middle of an intense panic attack a few years back. 

Thank you all for reading. I hope that everyone is well. Any responses will be greatly appreciated. ",Anxiety

I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments.

That night in hospital I was convinced I was gonna have a heart attack and die I was in so much pain and agony and in the ambulance the paramedics said my heart was going to fast but this was down to anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. Same in the hospital they tried to treat my heart with medication but they couldn't slow it down they said this was because it was not an irregular heart it was normal just a bit fast once again due to anxiety so I was left over night and discharged the next day. December 4th I dislocated my knee for the 2nd time and while waiting to be seen in hospital my heart went to fast so they put me in a ward over night and did all the tests bloody tests for my heart and ecgs nothing once again and anxiety once again. Then after that is when my intrusive thoughts started and that went on for a few weeks I still get it on and off now however. But the last 2-3 days my heart has been going fast I'm losing my breath easily and I can feel my heart palpitating I've had countless doctors and tests look at me and nothing to do with my heart? I've even rang a hotline about this and they said anxiety does all this it seems to go in a cycle my thoughts then everything is okay for a while then my heart and thoughts again can anyone help?,Anxiety

Previously I was missed diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. I’ve been on and off the same medication since I was 16. It’s currently not working so I’ve had to take a break again to try something new. I’m currently coming out of this depression part of my cycle. Usually the hypomania comes next because I’m so stressed out about how hard I fucked up whatever happened in the 3/4 weeks of depression. I struggle a lot with trying to cope self harm. I use to cut for almost two years when I was in high school, which was be main reason I got on medication to begin with. Throughout the years (16-21) I’ve gone on a few binders. When I was younger it was MDMA &amp; alcohol, when I became older it was alcohol. But was all stopped by the fact that I was pregnant. My kids have been the only reason why I haven’t slipped back into drugs or alcohol. I’m currently in outpatient treatment, I guess you would call it that. I go see two doctors to talk and sort out my feelings and try and find a program fitting for me. This has been the hardest fight of my life. I thought this was over but after I had my son it creeped right back for revenge. I had him in 2016 and I’ve basically missed half of his life because I don’t remember from being so depressed or my anxiety.  I’m in this place in my life now where I don’t even know where I am at everyday waking up. I feel like I don’t have a path anymore. I’ve lost focus in my career right now, I’m trying to pull myself back into this but I can’t. I’m mentally so exhausted I just feel useless. I fight so hard everyday to keep myself alive and calm, and then my two kids all alone. I choose to put myself here and I constantly wish I didn’t. I wish I could have given them a better start, or a better life currently. I have a job interview Wednesday, on Valentine’s Day. This is the first job I’ve gone to since October when I tried to kill myself. I left a job after one orientation because it was a trigger to me basically. I had to hold myself back from saying things, or doing things to this crazy woman who I found out lied about having cancer. I hold hope for this job, I hope this can change my routine into something healthy and I can actually enjoy going to work again. I miss life, I miss being able to enjoy life, I just miss me.

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",Depression

I just do not want to suffer. If my therapist points that out to me one more time as if that makes it somehow better I am going to lose my shit.

I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

46941,"Positive experiences with mood stabilizer? Hi everyone. 
So, I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses. 
Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently. 
So, I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel, and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But, that’s another story. 

Week 1
50mg of seroquel nightly 
450mg of depakote 

Week 2
25mg of seroquel nightly 
900mg of depakote 

Week 3
Stop seroquel

Since this pandemic happened my grades slipped a little. do not get me wrong, they are still good, going from 90s to 80s but not good enough apparently to get into university. I just do not like how the competition has increased. I mean, back in the day you did not need much to get in. I am stuck at a place where I cannot imagine myself doing the career ideas I have for 50 years. I know I am not the smartest, and I accept that. But its one thing to be ugly and have no close friends and its another thing to not even get into the university program you want. All my classmates seem to have it together. Its not like they are perfect either but they are over here getting jobs and learning how to drive and I lack the motivation to do anything. Rn I am doing online summer school and I am still managing to fuck that up. I did terrible on my unit exam. I know all of you all are just going to tell me to get up and work hard but honestly, I am tired of being an overachiever and not getting my results. Idek why I am posting this.

8309,"Okay, I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me: I am short and an ugly man (nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1).Okay, so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with ""What are you going to do?"". Hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon, if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults (or jokes as people call it) I would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height, they are like ""Oh I just cannot take you seriously"" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over, I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying ""NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg"" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as ""Oh gee I do not owe you anything""Now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen, I get told everytime some version of ""you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you *insert physical characteristics* but it is okay do not worry you will find someone"". Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected ""If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?"" And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip: If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out I am becoming what I hate, I hate people who show no emotion, I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts (I can link the study of you folks want).You know what, I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out, I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset, I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me ""just be yourself"" or ""put some effort in"" and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted.

I waste my life knowing I waste it and I will not get this dream life I thought my life was going to be like the first 26 years I spent on this life.I am currently 27, about to hit 28 and I found out last September right before I was going to turn 27 that I had a mild autism. 5 years prior to that I got epilepsy and I have been isolated from severe social anxiety and depression since 2011, which is the year I was diagnosed with ADD. While born with a stutter.I grew up thinking only my stutter was the only thing holding me back yet I felt like a fucking freak. A mistake of nature. But that I was going to at least satisfy my interest in cars by driving them, have me &amp; my friends journey life together, go to parties, live my teens like a teen, have girlfriends, have a job and not have anything stand in my way apart from a bit of a bump in my speech. But that was not the case. At all. I have always been this very mute, socially awkward guy everybody is scared of. Until they talk to me and find out I am not that bad. But with my inability to read so much socially I have to rely on others to start the conversation.This autism answers many questions. There are a lot of things I do not understand with this world when it comes to the social stuff. it is just so damn frustrating, because even if I want to be social and have friends I just do not fucking know how to do it. I am so out of touch with so much on the internet despite fucking being isolated on it for 10 fucking years. Been so damn scared of social stuff that I have just played singleplayer games and watched a few youtube channels over and over and over because discovering stuff is also so damn... scary somehow. Everything just falls down and confuses me. Fucking everything. I get the impressions and how you should think to crash with each other. To name a few, you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey. I am just so confused so when I pick on youtube channels, music artists and such I pick from groups of people I follow that I think are not mainstream/casual and not edgy but in the middle and go from who they know. And how people find these in the middle or edgy people are so confusing to me. Same with everything ""internet""/meme. Always wondered that. I feel so outside, so lacking in everything.

10246,"Hello my name is thomas. I have been feeling weird kind of symptoms and I would like to have some help to get to know what is going on with me. My symptoms are bothering me and I would like to have some guidance on what to do and what they are. So basically about 2-3months ago I started having panick attacks. I was feeling anxious pretty much everyday. I was not happy with this pandemic, school and my friends. I was starting to feel down. Also, I would feel very anxious about my health. Every sensation in my body that was odd I would focus on it and react in a small stress. I would vegan to panick when I would get a panic attack even tho I knew it was that. I would still panic and wait. Also after my panic attacks I would feel weird odd symptoms the few following days. I would feel low on energy, chills and weird zaps in my head. Until one day, in may, I started being very irritated at everything and I would constantly get uncomfortable symptoms when I did daily activities like gym, go out with friends. I would feel very light sensitive, a tiny nausea some times and a lot of stress when I got odd symptoms. There would also be this feeling of fear and feeling down. Even tho I was with my girlfriend I constantly had this weird fear of living. I would think I would die any second when I would experience odd symptoms. Then In June it got worse. I was having anxiety symptoms and panic attacks almost everyday. I would say 5 time a week. I notice during the day I would get this sick feeling with all kinds of symptoms. Per exemple i would feel my body changing temperature, brain zaps, my heart beat felt irregular, I was getting very tired and feeling very drowsy. And then it escalated into a panic attack. But when it was in the evening I would feel completely normal and everything was fine. But I would start to think about why was I feeling that and trying to figure out what was going on with my brain and body. So I would worry and overthink. And the cycle would continue. Until one day the June 15, after having bad anxiety symptoms, I notice a numbness in my brain. Like I could not feel my emotions anymore. I was trying to feel happy, I know that I was happy, I was able to express it but I could not feel it. So I started panicking about that. As the days went by the panick attacks were slowly fading away, and when I was having one, I felt the physical sensations but my brain like did not care. I did not feel that adrenaline rush and that panic feeling. I cannot feel stress anymore. Its very hard to feel love, happy, satisfied. My pschyatrist prescribed me 25mg sertaline and said that that would help. I kept explaining her my symptoms and she was saying its all anxiety and seem like she did not care. I did a blood test, it came back fine. Right before I started the meditation, the numbness and my physical symptoms were very bad. I lost the feeling of hunger and fullness, the ability to feel tired, to feel heat, and to feel emotions. It felt like if my brain had a brick wall the seperates me from feeling my body. you can feel the empty feeling. Now I am on week 3 of sertaline and some symptoms calmed down. But I am still experiencing this numbness. I would wake up and feel like empty. I still get trouble feeling hunger and I get weird stools. I am still a bit worried on what is going on with my body. Can you help me re assure what I am having and teach me techniques to overcome this suffering please I would really appreciate it.

51688,"Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym , I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone, can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky, eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling, and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me, it's an extremely shitty thing to do.

I have lost more than most people ever will and I do not say that to spite people nor say their pain is less than mine.&amp;#x200B;I could write a book about the crap I have been through, I have actually.

What in the FUCK did I do in my past life or whatever to deserve this? Seriously, I want to know. Was I like, Hitler or something?&amp;#x200B;You may ask yourself ""he cannot be that bad, right?"" And you would be wrong.&amp;#x200B;I will give you a brief overview immediate victim of favoritism within the first 3 years of life. I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years. parents stole me from each other, back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly, sexually abused me frequently and to top it off, keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows, no clocks, no way to tell time. Leaving me in there for days at a time. This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed, my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost. He only got me back for the SSI check. Other than that, I did not exist to him pretty much in school, I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats, I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis. Their laundry was, mine was not. already extremely socially isolated, things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital. Made me realize what a monster I was. during the last couple years of high school, I found my high school sweetheart. We were together for 7 years. We made a son together. he is currently 17, turning 18 later this year. social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots, which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots. So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head. Tell her she does not need me. She leaves me, takes me to court for 100% custody. At that point, I did not think I could possibly be more broken. I did not have a choice, so I just gave up and within 2 months, she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another. a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new. Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship. I could never trust her. still, she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me. I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run, run away from me. I suppose in some way, I did just not in so many words. towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn. His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck, killing him days before he was due. Just a few days. we split ways after this. I took the loss personally, as though it was God's way of punishing me for being the monster I was. Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself. All failed, obviously. a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family. So naturally, I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her. while we were in person together, things were amazing. It was like gravity, we could not stay away from each other. But when the time came to part ways... that is when things got ugly, fast. still, we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son. I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did. We had talked about several times. I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me. Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father. First her, it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with. So that is what she did. He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born. after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me, I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life. I just gave up. She was not going to change her mind ever. So I walked away. more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me. So that is what I did. I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life. something clicked inside, like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently, I became different than who I was before. The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born. I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family, but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship. This one was actually pretty good. I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship. I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son, her friends, her family. I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her, open to the idea this could last, it honestly felt like it was my forever home. I let myself actually believe in that. as you may suspect, things eventually fell apart. She pulled away from me, stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her, communicate what was going on to no avail. The day we broke up, she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sister-in-law's dog. Well, I found out that that whole story was a lie, just from a Facebook post of her sister-in-law at home with her two children, getting ready for the weekend. in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love. Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now. at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore. I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again. So what else is there for me? I could never have my family, cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable. I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time, wasting my therapist's time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of love.&amp;#x200B;that is just a chunk of my iceberg. The super short, short version. I suppose that is why it is so hard for me to believe that anyone could even comprehend the things I have been through. The bottom is not where you think it is.

46632,"I used amphetamines to trigger mania. So I have bipolar II and since I started medication (mood stabilizers with ssri's that supposedly affect the noradrenaline (don't know the correct english term) just like stimulants)
Since I started this I managed to pull out of my cannabis addiction, alcohol problem and get my grades up.

Last year I tried elvanse (active substanse lisdex(in swedish) amphetamine on two occasions and it triggered a full blown mania episode for a solid month. Like not even hypomania, mania.

Today I did the same but I could only get my hands on normal street amphetamines, I snorted around 0.3g of it on different occasions between 07:00 and 13:30, where I snorted 0.2g. The effect should wear off around 21:30. Should I expect the same thing?

I am very careful when it comes to this, and I know it's a bad idea just talking about the substance itself. But how bad is this, could this lead to developing bipolar I? I had a much worse deppressive period during autumn than I usually do. The same duration but worse and it led to drug/alkohol problems when I first started ssri without mood stabilizers.

I am certain this period was because the stimulant even though I only used it twice during spring when I didn't have any medication. But could this be remedied by just using this substance every couple of month and keeping my regular medications?

I remember the time when I was 17 and she would constantly take my phone and go through it when she drank, and one of my friends sent me a chain text about buying pot from him. I did not even smoke. She called him and screamed at him, and then she screamed at me. I remember being 21 and she slapped me in the face, grabbed my arm as I tried to storm out, and when I yanked my arm out from her grip, she fell and said she was going to call the cops on me, and that they would arrest me because ""I am a man and she is a woman."" I remember being 16 and trying to work up the nerve to go downstairs and get a bowl of cereal, because I was afraid.I feel like my brain shut itself down back when I was a kid. Said that it was going on autopilot, because there was no other way. And I have spent all that time since then alone. In my room. By myself. Doing nothing to better myself.

No doctor has ever been able to figure out. So I am forced to just live in pain and basically act like its not there if I want to try and do much of anything. I had dreams and goals since I was in HS. I wanted to be a P.H.d molecular biologist doing some sort of academic research or work in industry. I worked really hard and got into the best uni in my state, got a full ride, and during college did fairly well with a lot of new aspirations developing. I was depressed on and off during this time. Usually having to do with girls or test grades or finances. Stuff that you can deal with. But all in all i had a lot of friends and would say I was generally a happy person.Then the headache hit. I always thought it would just go away one day but as the months grew I started to isolate and become incredibly depressed. I got through school but it was so ugly. Had to use substances just so that I could even study molecular biology. At this point I was starting to get really upset with everything. Often I would get upset with my friends and peers because they did not have to deal with this. I would get invited to stuff but honestly nothing is fun anymore, especially social situations. I moved across the country after college to get a job and hopefully start fresh. But nothing changed. At this point I am basically certain this medical condition and the depression are here to stay forever. Imagine having a good child hood, got everything we needed, great education growing up, no child trauma at all, get a full ride for the school/degree you have been wanting for years and graduate. Only to realize that nothing you accomplish will make you happy. It hurts more than the headache itself lately. My soul is wounded and I have completely lost hope. I have been on and off meds for a few years and none of them help.And the thing that makes me suicidial is when my friends and family act like I am doing great because I have a fancy job a nice car and my own place. I have told them how I experience the world and some of them just do not believe it and attack my character. I feel like a lost sheep alienated from the world. I am basically jealous of every single person I interact with. Lately I will be walking around near my apartment and I will seriously get jealous of homeless people. All I want is to enjoy this beautiful world and enjoy my accomplishments and the company of loved ones. depression and chronic health problems",Depression

33963,"Head injury worries? I constantly worry about head injuries, because I constantly worry if a hit to my head was significant to cause a concussion. 


For example, I was laying in bed on my (not very heavy) laptop, and I accidentally pushed it into my chin. It wasn't a super hard hit, it didn't hurt, but I immediately started worrying that I could have a concussion. My head was against a pillow too, but the reading I did claimed that it's worse if your head doesn't move.


I mean, I don't notice myself feeling especially nauseaous or dizzy, but I can't stop worrying. It seems like most concussion stories involve something more significant than that. Are small hits like that something to worry about? Does anyone have any expertise as when to start worrying about a concussion?",Anxiety

I am not even sad that I am suicidal, I am just pissed that I know I am too stubborn to change. it is not like I do not want to change, I have wanted to get better for like 3 years but no matter how much I try or how close I come, I always end up being the same asshole who puts on a facade for everybody he knows so that nobody has to worry about him which only leads to him trying to kill himself. it is happened 7 fucking times, you would think by now I would try to stop this trend but whoopdi-fucking-doo I am unable to change and fetishize my own sadness as a result.

16012,"I do not know who I can talk to, or say anything regarding to to in person. I know that it is not right. I have been suffering for the past month, when me and my ex broke up and I came back to my home country as I had moved to be with her, I had hope we would be together again at some point etc, and seeing we were renting a place together I left her all of my money so she could afford the rent as alone she could never. So I did, however I have her bank account on my phone (did not anymore) because we shared it, so I kept getting notifications about deliveries, such as uber eats, deliveroo, just eat (fast food). My money was partially being used for this on a daily basis, over 100 pounds were used in under 5 days. I contested her about it she kept treating me like trash, and I demanded the money back with the promise that I would send her the money back when rent was due, atleast this way I knew it would be there for the reason it initially was. She ended up sending me the money, we talked a couple times and everytime we did she would rub on my face how much better she is now without me, how she is quote on quote ""living her best life"", and obviously sure this is fair but I do not want something rubbed on my face such as that when I am clearly suffering. The following day we talked again and I told her that I truly plan on killing myself, and whilst I was explaining why and how she messaged me her PayPal mid video call, to send her the money before I do so. Yesterday (17th) was the day I was supposed to give her the money back and I ended up not doing so, because I do not deserve to be treated like this, or atleast I do not. I was insulted by her on many different occasions, kept being told I am a horrible person and manipulative, she kept saying ""yea everyone said you would not send it back yet here I was thinking you would have some consideration in you"" , when well...I changed countries in december just to live with her, so I feel like she cannot contest that I care for her. Nonetheless yesterday our final message before she blocked me on a social platform was her telling me ""all the stuff you have on your instagram saying you hope we will get back together, and one day our paths will cross once more, forget about them because I will not allow myself to stoop so low for someone like you"" and that really hurt me, and although I feel like she will not ever come back, I did not want that to be said it that way. I was really hurt all day yesterday and had really awful dreams regarding this situation. I woke up and I heavily started considering, flying back to her country, murdering her and killing myself. I do not know what to do. I cannot exactly explain why this would be the right decisiona nd I am sure it is not however, it feels like for once she would understand even if for a second, how it is to be on the suffering side.

There is something that just acts and does not think.My relationsship with two of my friends is damaged because they did some shit to me... I, in person, want to forgive them. I said this. But I always think about it. I always think about how they left me and now be like ""hey we are friends, right?"". I am not the same since they left me once and I told them but they cannot fix this of course. It happened and I want to overcome this.

35609,"Maybe you do have a health condition, but it's more likely to be benign/chronic than whatever you're imagining I used to have bad health anxiety. Until I was diagnosed with POTS: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

What is POTS? At it's core, it's an increase in heartrate when you're standing. To be diagnosed you need to have a standing heartrate that's 30+bpm higher than your supine (lying down) heartrate.

But what is POTS really? It's a complex condition of the autonomic nervous system. There are dozens of possible symptoms, all somewhat benign, ranging from heart palpitations to nausea to trouble regulating temperature. Some people with POTS aren't affected much while others are confined to a wheelchair because of their fainting spells. Yes it can be a terrible experience, but it is *not fatal.*

So why am I telling you guys this?

Because there's a 100 conditions like POTS. Simple, relatively ""harmless"" conditions that make you feel uncomfortable, but pose no risk to your life. To name a few:

* Raynauds disease - intensely cold fingers/toes
* Fibromyalgia - pain/aches in muscles
* Arthritis - pain in bones
* Asthma - difficulty breathing
* TMJ - jaw pain, headaches
* Crohn's disease - abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, vomiting
* Cyclic vomiting disease - recurring vomiting spells
* Ovarian cysts - pain in pelvis, back or side
* Hypothyroidism - fatigue, weight gain, hair loss
* Anemia - fatigue, coldness
* Sleep apnea - sleepiness, snoring

I'm not saying that it's easy to live with these conditions. No way. Most of them suck. HOWEVER, they are not cancer, they are not heart disease, they are not multiple sclerosis.

So when you're listing your symptoms, focus on what the *most probably cause*. Neck pain? You probably have ""text neck"". Stomachache? You probably ate something that your stomach doesn't agree with. Headache? You probably have some environmental or dietary trigger.

/r/healthanxiety is very near and dear to my heart. I spent many anxious nights terrified because of heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, muscle cramps. I can't tell you how much of a weight off my shoulders its been to have a diagnosis. (I should've mentioned that the caused of my POTS is mitochondrial dysfunction, which comes with another huge slew of symptoms)

I hope anyone here with an undiagnosed chronic condition can find a diagnosis and treatment asap. I know it's hard to keep your head on straight until that happens, but try to! You are your best advocate.

I try to stay connected with him in the only way that I can, which is through setting up weekly video gaming sessions with him, where on a Friday, we will spent 5h or so playing through Dark Souls or Bloodborne or something that requires a lot of communication and coordination between us. he is happiest when he and I are kicking ass or have vanquished an invader. Sometimes I try to ask him how he is doing inside, and if he spends time talk to himself - but he literally shuts me down, and then goes silent for hours at a time. I see a therapist for my own issues, and that work that I have done there has helped me a lot. I believe that he sees his own situation as being so dire that he cannot fathom a way out. He does not get along well with my parents, he is extremely bad tempered and lashes out to them. They do not know how to handle him at all, and the situation is completely out of their control or emotional/mental ability to resolve. They all need help, tbh, but it has to begin with my brother (in my opinion, which is not a professional opinion by any means). In August I am going to visit them for two weeks. I am bringing my dog with me, who I hope will help soften my brother a bit, as he is genuinely kind hearted and loves animals. My goal is to try and find some time to allow him to open up, and share his thoughts and feelings, but he seems so hardened, and up until now, I have failed time and time again to get him to open up.

I recently did some genetic testing through my psychiatrist and the results came back that I would highly benefit from stimulants, if I had the need to take them.(Also said I should never take SSRIs and all atypical antipsychotics will make me gain weight- fun facts) I know it’s very uncommon, and I’ve read some horrible things about having bipolar and taking stimulants (mania, psychosis, etc) but my pdoc put me on 20mg to see if it could help with my cognitive and executive function.

Does anyone have experience with taking Vyvanse without one of the regular prescribed  diagnosis?

Also, if you take Vyvanse just in general, how did you deal with the crash? First day taking it and I feel like hell, it’s been about 10-11 hours since I took it now.

Angry at myself and everyone else that I am not dead and do not have the bottle to end it, my step brother died a couple of years ago from an accidental recreational drug overdose and I wished it was me, he was only 18! Why is the world so cruel?This of course highlighted again how devastating a death in the family would be.Each day that passes I slip deeper and deeper into despair, I know this is happening I just cannot stop it, meanwhile my partner of 13 years has become a full-time alcoholic that blames me for every problem she has within herself, I am open-minded, but something tells me if she left me she would quickly discover these kind of problems are rampant within people our age.I am struggling to see the point anymore, pre-pandemic I was doing my dream job, still wanted to kill myself but found myself being too busy to even think about it that much... It was more of an inconvenient intrusive thought at that stage.We scraped our way through doing any work that was available, being mistreated at each company of course, I fear the mental scars that my partner and I now both have on top of our pre-existing issues is just too much to return to normality.She is pressuring me to have a child, people our age tend to feel like we are failing due to seeing previous generations achieve things that are 10x harder for us to facilitate, like providing security and stability for a child!I am receiving professional help, albeit very slowly via the NHS but the poor buggers are overrun as usual and things do not move quickly at all, I am wondering if other people can relate to this permanent lust for what is quite simply a smidge of happiness, I have never felt joy or pride or love and that is all I have ever wanted, I do not need money I just want fulfillment, I just want to wake up in the morning with no immediate desire to die!Let me know if you relate, I seem to feel better hearing other people relate to me otherwise I convince myself I am the problem!

I have to figure out which religion I'm going to follow (I believe in God but was grown up atheist, so religion is what I'm figuring out currently).

I've flown before, but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy, panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.

Specifically, I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fight/flight responses around takeoff and aviophobia, or *fears when the plane is in the air.* I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. 

But as I lay on my side writing this, I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.

I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10-minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.

It's crazy, I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. 

I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight, to sleep, to cry, to indulge in self-hatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now, but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today, because it was not going to get done. 

I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle, but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear it.

I still want to fly, deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.",Anxiety

52613,"Anxiety? I’m trying to figure out and address an issue I’ve had my entire life (or at least as long as I can remember). As I try to seek out treatment and help, I’m not sure if anyone here can relate.

I will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things. For example: If I overhear someone taking about a movie but I don’t know what the movie is, I may fixate on “Who did they say the lead was? An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie???” and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and I’ll need to get up and walk around. 
Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and I’ll obsess, wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that I’m reading. 
I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is, who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar, etc. 
You know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and they’ll say, “What IS that song? It’s going to drive me nuts?” For me it feels like that “going to drive me nuts” thing is for real. 
These “attacks” might also occur in certain circumstances of guilt or self-loathing.

I know money and her being a nepo baby (her father was also a race car driver before) helped her achieve big things, but she also wouldn't be where she is right now if she wasn't great. 

I just realized that I'm 2 years older than her and I'm about to repeat my last year of highschool (i dropped out this mid school year because of mental health reasons), and I still don't even know wtf I wanna do in life. 

My best friend is so fckin smart, she's studying right now to be a chemical engineer. My other best friend is also smart, all of his grade averages are 95+ (100 is the highest in my country). 

I'm surrounded by smart, and talented people with a future, people who will make a name for themselves and become rich in the future. People who have already carved their paths. While I'm here barely even making it through the day. I can't even go to school without wanting to off myself, while they're here working their ass off for their future.

My best friends don't even know I already dropped out of high school. I'm too embarrassed to tell them. How can I tell them? They would be too embarrassed to have a highschool dropout as a friend.

Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive( in school). I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didn’t believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is I’m very worried I’m developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if I’m worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But I’m just looking for advice.

11305,"My s/o was my driving force, but they turned out to be dating me out of pity. They were hiding the fact that they were aromantic from me because they felt bad that I was so excited to be with them. Were still best friends (its hard to break a friendship of almost 3 years), but now I feel like a burden to them. I felt so happy with them. Its the first time I felt loved or cared about. I even received my first compliment on my looks from them. My world came crashing down when I learned this was all hollow and insincere. I cannot begin to tell you how happy I was when they said I love you too. Now its the opposite because they just did that to make me feel appreciated. The first compliment I received in my life on my looks turned out to be the same story. I was so ecstatic to hear that I am pretty, but that feeling is gone since that was just a hollow compliment that meant nothing. I finally started to feel good about my looks after they told me I am pretty, but now I do not even want to post my face anymore. I feel like a burden to them now. This made my mental state go to shit, and now they have to deal with me like that. I still love chatting and calling with them even though I cry every time I do. they are the only thing keeping me going right now. they are still my driving force. Without them, I cannot say Id be alive right now.note: Please do not get mad at them for not telling me about being aromantic. They feel like absolute shit for not telling me in the first place and profusely apologized. They also were in major denial when they noticed they were aromantic and saw our relationship as a way to try and be normal (being aro is completely normal and okay by the way). They soon started to feel sick for not telling me this and felt terrible after noticing they should not of forced a relationship on themself. This was all caused because they tried to suppress their actual feelings without immediately noticing it (and me jumping into this way too fast) which is not their fault, so I do not want any hate directed toward them in the comments. i feel unwanted",Suicidal

34044,"Blood(???) in Stool Alright so this is an issue I’ve had on and off for years and I don’t know what to do. So basically, sometimes I have red spots in my stool. I say spots because it doesn’t fill the whole bowl, the whole stool isn’t red, just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. I’m 21 now, and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test, found nothing but a hemroid, sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. It’s happened on and off since then and usually I either know it’s hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however, it’s gotten worse. About a month ago, as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. I’ve been fine this past month, but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days I’ve noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still don’t really think it’s blood, but if that’s the case wouldn’t it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a “spot” as I’ve described. 

Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasn’t blood, and I feel going again will just lead to the same result. I’m just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and I’m just overly vigilante, as health anxiety definitely has made me, or is there more to it.

My marriage failed because I held on to tight to her when she needed me to let go and now there is no words to say to apologize or take back the pain I caused by suffocating her and then eventually cheating on her. But she still crosses my mind everyday. Even the relationship I tried to do everything right in failed because I am inherently bad as a person.

I get minor panic attacks on random moments and I can not seem to find any reason why.  
The most recent example is when I was asked to go on a team meeting outside of working hours. I felt almost frightened and felt like I wanted to cry and life is too overwhelming for me. Another example is a party I recently went to, I was scared to go for about two weeks (even though my gf and a friend were with me). There was literally nothing bad about it, but I was stressed up until the moment I got there.

When I try to think of a reason why I'm feeling like that, I do not have a single clue. My life is good and I have everything I need/want but I keep looking for small things that make me feel unhappy and anxious. I can stay awake and panic/overthink over all kinds of small things like this. I just want to feel happy and stop overthinking constantly but I do not know how to do that.

17206,"Feels kind of weird posting about this on Reddit, but if it helps then I might as well.I am 16 years old, depressed, and was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome at age 6, along with being tested for autism multiple times (none of them came back, and I am fairly certain I am not on the spectrum, or at least not noticeably) and Asperger's once. I had an abusive stepfather for about 9 years, from when I was 3 to when I was about 11-12. I have just finished my GCSEs, and I am waiting on my grades. I have always been a high achiever, always been placed on ""gifted and talented"" lists, always used to bury myself in science textbooks and documentaries. Back before I had access to the Internet, my education was almost a coping mechanism. Still, now it feels like a lot of other people deserve their academix success a damn sight more than I do. Compared to a lot of people on this subreddit, I should be incredibly lucky. But I do not think my luck can be much worse. I am in a friends with benefits type relationship with a girl that I have loved for about 2 years, and we still love each other, but I used to talk to her about all of my depression and suicidal tendencies and now we have got a strict rule that I cannot talk to her about it anymore. Which tbf is for the best. That does not mean it does not hurt though. I guess my main problem is that I feel isolated almost all the time. Even in a room of people I feel like I am alone. Sometimes even when I am with her. Back when I had that abusive stepfather, I remember sitting in my room, in a corner, too afraid to leave or even move until my mum came home. I have grown up since then, but on the inside that is still how I feel. I have gone through countless friend groups who do not give a shit about me, I have only ever found three or four ""real"" friends yet I feel awful telling them about anything I have experienced or I am feeling. I tried to tell my teachers that they were putting me under too much stress, and then they decide to tell my mum, when I asked them not to. Queue me being treated like an alien for weeks. I have written countless rants, suicide note drafts, sad monologues, and it is getting tiring. The suicidal stuff gets terrifying sometimes... I have a massive fear of death, but I do not want to keep on living in this kind of world. I am not always suicidal, and to be honest today has been a really good day for me. But it is not like that makes it go away. Sometimes I am scared of what is going to happen to me in X amount of years. In fact, that is pretty much all of the time. As I get older, I start to realise that my childhood is slowly slipping away from me, and that I should probably enjoy what is left of it as much as I can, yet...

17441,"Recently I have been diagnosed with mild to moderate depression and anxiety, and I have been given a treatment which consisted of vitamins and 5-HTP, but a month into this treatment and I am seeing no long term improvements. The only times I have felt better was when I first started (for like 4 days), then when I took a higher dose of 5-HTP, like my psychiatrist told me, and that improved my symptoms for about a week and a half.And now a whole month into the treatment I am feeling a lot better on the anxiety part, I am not that shaky anymore and I can sleep better and express myself a little bit more better, but on the depression part, I feel a lot worse. Today I felt worse than before I was on treatment. I felt like I did not want to do anything, my energy and motivation for anything was non existent. I did push myself and went to the gym, and went running for a bit, but that did not help. I am constantly pushing myself daily, even though it takes me longer than needed to complete my daily tasks.And I cannot help but think about my condition, and what if it is treatment resistant and the doctors will eventually give up on me. What then. And when that thought of even the professionals abandoning me came in my head, I could not help but think of a way to end it. Made up a whole plan in my mind, which would leave no trace. The thing is, professionals are my only hope now, and even though I can control my actions, like in not executing the plan that comes in my mind without me even wanting to think of it, I cannot control what I am thinking. I have told my psychiatrist that I think about suicide only hypothetically, on a ""what if"" situation, like ""what if I was gone"", I did not tell him I actually made up an entire scenario in my mind in fear of being locked in a mental health hospital.Monday I will have my next appointment with my psychiatrist, and I want to tell him that the current treatment is not working as intended, I just hope I will be able to hold on another week without losing my mind, because in this current state I am in, I cannot socialize or do anything and time passes really slow. I feel like I am getting distant with my friends, and none of them know what I am really going through, I did not tell anyone that I am on therapy and that I am following a treatment for this. I do not want to lose anyone. If now after treatment I am like this, I do not want to imagine how I will be in a month from now, or heck, a year, as my mental state has been worsening lately (even before the treatment) like no other time before.

I have also had several sui attempts in the past, two of which lead to fibrilation and being revived in an ER. I have been in and out of psych hospitals too, and receive the multi-thousand after it which did not help me at all. After all, debt is part of my problem and costing that much also just worsens my problem. I have not been able to hold jobs for longer than a few weeks with one exception for a program that helps disabled people. Anyhow, usually at work I ended up having catatonic episodes, panic attacks, and such too frequently for any employer to keep me around. I seem to do well in school, that is if I am able to complete a semester before a panic or my mental health leads me to drop out mid-semester(has happened several times). My intelligence seems to be the only thing going for me, but my job prospects would only be there if I can get a degree really, and formal education does not seem to work even though I get straight As in times where I finish a semester. But I am 26 and my formal education is only an associate's degree and who knows if I will ever get far enough in a reasonable amount of time? Then, in addition to these issues with me, the world is honestly hopeless. Wealthy elites screw over the rest of us, gaining exorbitant amounts of wealth during the pandemic while everyone else is struggling. Not to mention the rise in hate groups, f'ed up police, climate change, and I do not know a single person who has not suffered abuse of some kind(which seems to indicate humanity is also f'ed up). I mean, there is a myriad of things I bring up that is incredibly disheartening about the world, but I do not wish to make this rant much longer. So, pretty much the only things keeping me alive are 1) I do not want another multi-thousand dollar bill my parents have to foot from hospitals in case my suicide attempts fails again, and 2) I do not want to ruin their lives by losing me. But they are fairly old baby boomers, so I suspect it will not be long before they die. Hint: the only two things keeping me alive would no longer be true in that scenario.

I also struggle a lot with things like regularly changing out my sheets and blankets which definitely didn’t help. A couple days ago I saw a little bug crawling on my blanket. The last few days I’ve been finding more of them- another one on my bed, a few on my walls, my windowsill, in my closet, on the floor. I’ve been hypervigilantly looking for them at this point and changed all my bedding as well as finally washing some clothes but I think the damage is done. 

Because of the clutter, my room is filled with dust, especially in a few specific places, and I’m fucking terrified of what I could find there, especially under my furniture. But obviously I must already have an infestation. I’m scared to do ANYTHING in my room now because I know I’ll find more. My clothes that I couldn’t fit in the first wash round is still on the floor and I’m terrified to touch it because I feel like it’s crawling with bugs. 

I’m also guessing they’ve been there for way longer than I realize, so I don’t even know how long bugs have literally been crawling around in my bed with me. I was waiting for the day my room would get bugs and I’m guessing it happened recently because my parents stopped being on me much about cleaning my room after I turned 18.

i saw a doctor for this, she basically diagnosed me as overly anxious about my health, that it is all a mental thing. i agree in this because i AM always anxious about my health.

when my neck cracks, which is with many movements, not just occasionally but VERY frequently, i dont really feel any pain but it does worry me a lot.

my neck cracking gets worse when i am in certain positions or if i sit down on a chair for a long time.

sometimes with the pains i feel, like sharp stabbing pains occasionally in my head or wherever it may be, i am starting to feel overly anxious about them because i wonder if it could be because of my neck.

im only 17 but i have very bad posture and a sedentary lifestyle for many years now.

i am mostly concerned about the bits and pieces that i can shift in the back of my neck, they feel like tiny pieces of bone and i can move them around. everyone ive asked about this does not relate to what im saying at all! 

i also get headaches nearly every day, i have a bit of scoliosis, and tmj, so i wonder if this is related at all.

19782,"I used to be extremely hypersexual, but it was frustrating because I was not getting any. Citalopram massively reduced by libido and made it impossible to orgasm, but I did not mind this change at first. At one point I was taking 40mg, which is the highest allowable dose.After tapering off, my sexual function never fully returned and I kind of miss it. it is been over a year now. I was on the drugs for a few years.Prior to antidepressants, even at the age of 27, I would get random erections. I would sometimes get so aroused I would HAVE to masturbate or I would be agitated and could not think about anything else. Not to get too graphic, but I used to get a lot of pre-cum, and when I ejaculated I would squirt quite far, often over my head, and it would be A LOT of volume. It was easy to reach orgasm, and when I did they were intense.Now, the end of my dick is dry and lacks sensitivity. it is really hard to reach orgasm and I am significantly less aroused in the first place. I miss the thrill of trying not to cum prematurely. Now I cannot cum without vigorous stimulation and it does not even feel good. Did your libido never fully recover after quitting antidepressants?",Depression

I'm on short term disability leave, I got put on another team in a lower role for when I return to work, but i can't let this happen again.

My triggers Ive found are repeating myself, getting ignored completely, ""have time for a quick call?"", and having to do other people's jobs for them. Now this all being said, none of that should have been happening anyway because all that is supposed to go to my TOM, not me.

They're letting me back in little by little to avoid another nervous breakdown next week, but I'm already feeling the stress.

The fast HR and pounding feeling for literally months essentially with no breaks. My entire life has been Halted because I can't do anything. I take a shower and my heart goes a million miles an hour and my blood pressure goes to the 140's over 90. Brain fog and dizziness. Tinnitus like crazy and this weird whooshing sound and pain from my neck .
It all started with going to the doctor bc I had Thunderclap headaches after orgasm, which lasted everytime for 2 weeks then just stopped. Then I started feeling worse and that stopped but all this started. I've had an echocardiogram, several EKGs from the ER visits, an MRI 3 months ago no contrast, a CT with contrast of my chest and neck last month, a CT with contrast of my head last week. Noone can find anything. Only suggestion my doc had Thursday was potentially ICP and he looked worri3d that's what it was and said if I get a headache go to the er. Which I did 2 days ago to which they didn't do bloodwork but they did a CT and Xray . Tested my eye movement . Then gave me a shot and sent me home. 
I obviously need to continue to see my doctor and will. Just 4 months of this I'm trying to reach out for things to recommend to my doctor to test for and try because they're struggling hard. The only things I can even think of personally anymore is craniocervical instability, anxiety, and maybe clogged artery issues. With the ICP he thought, which is phesable I have 95 percent of the symptoms but the numerous head CTs and the MRI showing no pressure(doesn't rule it out) and the fact that it's been 4 months since it all began and I've not stroked out or anything makes it seem not entirely sure for me personally. But I'm not a doc, ill continue to do what they tell me, but man if I can I wanna try to nudge them the right way",Stress

48264,"Why do I find the Spring so depressing? A lot of people talk about the Winter blues, but for me Spring by far (at least in recent years), is painfully depressing. 

It’s like the smell in the air, mixed with the temperature and longer/brighter daytime present this fake sense of happiness. 

It’s as if when I’m outside, things seem “too happy” and that scent in the air is gut-wrenchingly nostalgic of a past-time that can never be felt or experienced again. Because I’m not capable of it and I’m too worn-down to, anyway. 

I actually remember when I was little (29 now) that I loved clear, sunny weather. I looked up the forecast almost obsessively ahead of time, banking on those days of where there are no clouds to block the sun. Not even partly cloudy. 

It’s perplexing to think I was once like this since nowadays, I despise sunny weather. I genuinely feel better and more comfortable when it is cloudy with rain. Especially the eccentric types of weather where it looks as if nighttime has arrived too early, but instead it’s just a storm brewing. Not to mention, I am at my peak mindset and performance late at night.

barely made it through high school. i still haven't taken my 11th grade exam even though it's due soon. i haven't actually studied in years because i've had too much shit going on to focus. i did online school from 6th grade to 9th grade and have been fully homeschooled since. my brain's turned to mush. i failed every subject besides science and history so now my grades are too low to get into college. i also can't attend college because it's too much money. we literally have like 60 dollars in the bank bc someone lended it to us but it's gonna be gone soon cause my mom blows it on shit we don't need

12025,"Hey guys! My partner recently (2 months ago) suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown (for want of a better phrase). He was on citalopram for about 4 years previous to this and in January he started to slowly come off it, tapering the dose very gradually over the next few months until he got down to 10mg. At this point he hit a total low and got a shock so jumped himself back up to 30mg (not the best idea but he panicked). A few weeks later is when he suffered his mental breakdown, the weeks prior being full of mood swings, irritable, quick to anger, irrational thinking etc etc. Eventually it got too much. The crisis team got involved and the doctor decided that citalopram probably was not the best thing for him anymore so switched him to mirtazapine, cross-titrating it with cit for the first couple of weeks (8 weeks ago). After a couple of weeks they dropped his cit completely and upped his dose of mit to 30mg from 15mg. Its been 6 weeks since this point. At first he seemed to be getting better but about 4 weeks ago started suffering massively with depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, extreme paranoia (effecting our relationship), obsessive thoughts, total irrational thinking, an inability to keep the bad thoughts in, quick to anger, what he calls brain tizziness which is a physical feeling apparently, tunnel vision, all the rest, you name it. Hes really struggling and is at the point where hes getting really distressed and upset at the thought that hes the only person who has ever been through this and worried that it will never get better, or maybe that hes crazy. He was discharged from the crisis team 2 weeks ago but I fear that was too earlyI was wondering if anyone here has had such horrific side effects for so long? How long did it take for them to subside? What did you do to deal with them? Is there anything I can do to help?

46151,"crosspost from /advice I'm at a crossroads with career due to mental illness I'm 26 I do tier 1&amp;2 tech support and other IT tasks at a decently sized fortune #### company.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar for 6 years. Anxiety and previously depression for 15


I've been having one of the worst depressed episodes in years. We're going on 5 months now. Typically when I have an episode and I'm working the either the collateral damage from the mania or stagnancy from the depression lead to me losing my job.  But with this one I have short term disability insurance and FMLA so my job is protected. 


I'm at home thinking about what I want to do with my life and if the life I lead could be contributing to the stress I feel. I went to high school for writing and was a college drop out for film.  I have a passion for the arts, a talent for the science, and an interest in a lot of other fields.  And surmountable debt from my previous studies.
  

Part of me knows the reasonable thing would be to go back to work, but it feels like a big ol wall is blocking me.


The tricky thing is that the disease makes you feel like moving and making changes and starting new projects and idk if thats what that really is.  I could use some outside insight


I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to go back to school and apply for disability/scholarships/ect or continue down the technology path.

26082,"I have been very depressed for quite some time now. My daughter is autistic and I never feel like I am doing enough for her. I have been bullied all of my life and do not have any friends. I cannot date due to how my daughter is and because I only attract abusive men. I have gained a bunch of weight and my looks have gone down the drain. I am also just not very smart and I have never been talented at anything (even my own mom cannot come up witanything that I am good at, other than being a mom). I have been wallowing for a long time over these things and it is been exhausting.For the past week, though, I have been thinking about how the only one that matters is whether I am doing enough for my daughter or not. I have only been selfish by worrying about whether I have friends, romance, looks and talent. It finally dawned on me that my purpose in life is to love and care for my daughter and to only strive for things that will directly benefit her. This is actually helping me to become more focused on my goals, and I am actually looking into going back to school so that I can get a better job (purely to benefit her, not for my own enjoyment). I am also trying to be physically healthier, but this time it is so that I can be healthier for my daughter, not so that I can look attractive or for any other selfish reasons. Anytime I feel a bit down about any of these things, I redirect my thoughts away from myself and towards my daughter. I am finding that I am slowly but surely thinking about myself less and less, because I no longer matter to myself. I do find that I am a bit nervous to go back to school because, like I said earlier, I am not all that smart. Hopefully I can find a course that will work for me.Moral of my story is that the only thing that matters to me is my daughter and that I do not need any of those other things that apparently contribute to happiness.

Just here to put my story down and try to summon the courage to end this shit existence. I am 55 y/o. Never had a girlfriend worth speaking of; my longest 'relationship' was perhaps 2 weeks, and that was what you would call 'long distance.' I just finished a master's degree program in library science, and now have 120k+ in debt. I also just had open heart surgery, from which I am recovering. I have no friends. I have someone in my life who pitied me enough to give me a place to stay during my first ten days of recovery, as it seems the doctors insisted that I not be alone. I have been alone since my father died nearly ten years ago. I have no siblings or family. Maybe 1 cousin who might give enough of a shit to she would a tear when they find out I have checked out of this mad-house asylum they call the world. I have no children, obviously. I do not have any one who would miss me. I cannot remember the last time one of my friends called. I have tried to reach out, but everyone has their own lives, and not much time to spend on old friends. I do not tell anyone or let on that I want to die. I am not big into drama. The hospital asks their routin questions, but I always deny any sucidal thoughts, as I am not going to let them institutionalize me or put me on some list where I cannot get the firearm that will get me out of this hell. So I sit and I think about this every day. I should have not even bothered to call the fucking ambulance when I started to have angina pains. The result was an emergency bypass. I wish I would have died on that fucking table. It would have been painless. Now I am stuck with this shit and no prospects of a job. I have not even had a job in nearly 2 decades. I am looking at exit bags, but that seems like a lot of work. I think I am just going to get a sleeping bag and a gun. The sleeping bag will at least make clean-up easy for the landlady, who seems nice enough. there is no fucking point to any of this, and I have finally realized that I have to do it. I am going to set things in motion since there is a 2 week waiting period for the gun. Kind of sucks that i have to wait two weeks. I hope my resolve does not waiver. there is nothing left for me at this point. do not look at me as an example to emulate. My life is shit and I clung to hope in the face of hopelessness.

Between the Saphris and the lamictal I have been the most stable I have Ever been.

A man that always told me how strong I was even though I do not have the physique he used to have, he was muscular, strong and kind as a gentle giant, still he always looked at me when we wake up as I was ""Hercules"" or some hero of the ancient times and he used to say: ""My love I wish someday I could be half as strong as you are"". &amp;#x200B;I want to jump into the abyss or more like just stop holding on to life, but I do not want to die.

17908,"I have been so stressed lately. I have not gotten hardly any sleep. I have been depressed my whole life. For more than a decade. My parents used to be so excited about the colleges I wanted to get into and apply to and I was too. This was 4 years ago. Depression really hit my senior year of high school and I barely made it out of high school. My parents moved states for job promotions that year and they wanted me to go to a state college where they were because I guess they thought Id be better off. I chose this college over a much better college because I did not want to disappoint them. I actually had a great time at this college the fall semester. When the spring semester came, I got hella suicidal and my ptsd took full force. I started having nightmares and I got hospitalized. I dropped out of this college to be in the city of this college I really wanted to go to. Turns out i needed more credits to transfer so I took classes at community college. I was so motivated at first but then depression followed me once again. I dropped all my classes that semester and the semester after. I tried to do it but I could not. Then the next year I finally decided to take a break from college altogether. During that break I decided I really liked being in school so that next school year I kicked ass in all my classes. I made all As. Surely this would be enough to get me into the college I dreamed of going to. Or so I thought. I got rejected from it and now Ill be going to a commuter school that is not prestigious at all. I worked so fucking hard in grade school only for my depression to ruin every fucking thing. I do not even know if a degree would be worth the pains now. I just want to kill myself. I am a disappointment and failure. I should have killed myself at 17 instead of believed people when they said things get better. If I could see my future at 17, no way I would have missed the opportunity to successfully kill myself. I screwed up so bad. I am a failure who has no direction. Depression ruined my chances of going to a top college and graduating with my peers",Depression

I've convinced my doc to give me an adderall script because im genuinely afraid that my lamictal brain is not adequate for passing my January exams. 

Adderall is making me sleep 6 hours a night which makes me feel amazing. I used to sleep 6 hours back before I was medicated, and it feels just so fucking good. for some reason, the less I sleep, the better I feel. I haven't felt this fucking energized in a while. I only took 20mg 2 days ago, and 10mg yesterday. 

Im making this post because:

1) I was wondering if any of you have a similar situation where less sleep makes you feel better? And if you have any similar medication history and if you can provide any insight into this situation to me? How did these realizations help you and what were your next steps?

2) If I told my doctor that adderall was making me sleep less, would she take it away from me? I only take it to study, but I fucking love sleeping 6 hours. I felt well rested when I woke up today for the first time in like 6 months. Im wondering if I can tell her this information or if she would be worried about it triggering mania.

10122,"I am not really sure what I am expecting from this, but it probably cannot do any harm.I (18M) have been depressed for a little under a year now and feeling suicidal on and off for most of that time. Recently, things have worsened and I have started cutting myself and I feel like I am on the edge of just killing myself. I have not really got much to feel depressed about on the surface, I live in a wealthy part of the UK, I have got a decent family and I was lucky to go to a good enough school and have opportunities. But that does not change how I feel, which is hopeless and pretty neglected. I have always been the quiet, reserved one and I have not minded that so much, I have always been fine with my own company, especially since I was bullied mercilessly as a child. People who know me well get more humour and jolliness than strangers, but almost nobody knows anything actually personal about me. Since I have always lived fairly far from town, I never really had the same friendships as everyone else, or the freedom to go out and make them, even in my teenage years. It has left me feeling lonely, especially since many friends over the years have simply abandoned me. Simply put, I never seem like anyone's first choice, my parents have always focused on my brothers more than me and my friends are not really there for me at all; they never have been. Not one of them has asked if I have been OK in the last year, despite my still spending time in groups with them. I have tried asking for help or support, but I never know how to say it. I have always been very good at hiding my own feelings and problems and been the one who listens, who solves other people's problems. ""Hey I am depressed and want to off myself, got any tips?"" is not the best conversation opener I have ever heard. I knew a friend who described the looks he got when his depression became evident to his friends - ""like a wounded animal"". He described how he felt everyone was permanently walking on eggshells around him. I do not want that for myself, especially not since I know that my parents would never let me out of their sight knowing I was suicidal.My boyfriend, well, where to start. I genuinely thought he was the one, stupid at my age as that sounds, I know. Everything had going so well, but I wonder if our relationship has stopped being healthy recently. He sometimes becomes argumentative and angry when we are texting about things, and criticises things about me, my life and my family. Some of it is quite fair, but the sheer hate and rage bordering on contempt I feel from him when he does this hurts me a lot. Most of the time he is sweet and funny and never angry in person, but the angry episodes online have become more frequent. I have tried standing up a little more for myself (which I find very difficult in general) or asking for him to be kinder with me, but nothing really changes. I am beginning to wonder if he is emotionally abusive or not, but it is hard for me to tell anything about anything at the moment while I have a lens of depression over everything I think. Resisting the cognitive distortion that he hates me like everyone else is already using a lot of my energy.To be honest, I could go on all night giving tired rants about this that and the other that is gone wrong in my life or that I hate about myself, but I will not bore you with all that. Suffice it to say, I have got no hope left and I am tired of going through the effort of living everyday. I hate that my reaction to anything bad happening now is the urge to cut myself, and I have been wishing for death every day for some time now. If everyone knew how much I was hurting they would probably treat me better but that is not really the point, is it.I have decided I will kill myself in 4 days, but I do not know how yet. I fear death, but I do not want to live any more.Thank you for reading if you got this far, I am sorry I wrote so much - it just sort of happened. I have had enough",Suicidal

Something got ""switched off"" about my personality 3 years ago and I don't think I can do it anymore. But I still have all the jokes I wrote, 6,500 of them.

What if I get it completely polished to something I'm happy with, go leaps and bounds, the extra mile, whathaveyou... and don't sell a single copy? I'm so worried about my future. To boot, I don't have any friends and I haven't had a girlfriend in 5 years. I am pretty good-looking but feel so pathetic about my life, the no money, the broken character, the friendlessness. I'm fortunate to be a 6'2"" Caucasian male with a history of health and fitness, so now that I'm getting sober and focusing more on the gym, I have the plausibility to get really aesthetic.

Everything still feels the same no matter what med, new routine, holistic solution, etc. I am exhausted of living. So, in March of 2020, I attempted suicide. I lived alone in a nice apartment; I locked the door to my suite, flipped the security latch, taped a handwritten DNR sign in my living room, locked the door, and I took an uncountable amount of Clobazam (not Clonazepam, different drug), 100 Gravol pills, and at least 50 nighttime Benadryl pills. I got into bed and listened to Strict Machine by Goldfrapp. Then, a feeling Id never felt before I was done. I felt like Id finished life. It was so soothing. It also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills I took. My then-girlfriend called me, and we have a fine conversation. This is where I black out. She tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. I was completely coherent, and then just stopped talking. This is when I passed out. Long story short (too late), I wake up two days later in intensive care. Tube in my throat to regulate breathing. Catheter definitely in. Guess my DNR did not work. My parents (who live four hours away) are sitting around me as I come to. Fast forward, I convince everyone I am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and I said no, I will get better care when I move back to the city.

I continue to comply with the Ministry of Transportation to get my drivers license back. They keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. My depression/anxiety stays the same.

50167,"My mania just ended and I think im going to spiral soon I (25f) started my new job while I was manic and I made so many friends and I felt happy but then the monthish after I realized I was manic. I was drinking every day. I was.. a lot. But they loved it I think. I was fun. I was energy.

Now I'm on the other side and the timing feels bad. I don't want people to start hating me again. It's not like they actually understand what bipolar is. I want to be more than who I am when im manic but I feel most myself and useful when I am. 

I've tried talking to 7 psychiatrists now, and 4 or 5 therapists. One, who specialized in c-ptsd and bipolar  who was also a colored woman I was so excited about, she ghosted me. I don't want to recant my traumas anymore. I can't handle it. I feel like I'm in a whirl pool but I can't tell if it will pull me under or just keep spinning me and spinning me. Boats are passing by but im not drowning so why stop?

I just need some kind words from people who hear me and not just listen and tell me to wait. I don't know what to do lol",Bipolar

49111,"Might leave job and feeling guilty Hey. I've been here about my stress before, but for those who don't know. I'm a student in gymnasium (11th grade), and I got stress, motivation and depression issues.
Recently we've had a young-worker shortage, causing me to shift weekends. Before I had weekends with my favourite manager (let's call him Peter), and my favourite collegue, now I'm with a leader I hate (Let's call him Donald). He doesn't respect us, it's always our fault, so on so fourth. I've used this work as a productive outlet, where I can feel like I have a purpose, however it has still layed pressure on me.
I want to quit now, not because I don't want the money, but because I can't keep this up with stress, and with the new leader, I feel like it's going up in flames.
Problem is, I feel really guilty for it. Peter is the guy who has to deal with it, and we are currently lacking 5 workers, and the company is in need of me. But I just can't handle this, the new weekend was a breaking point for me. What should I do?",Stress

11083,"Honestly it feels like I am living a hell that was created for me. My father was negligent and never bothered to spend time with me, blaming it on the fact that I looked unapproachable. To this day he still owes my mother 8k in child support. My mother was abused and so, i too was abused both physically and mentally. I remember that when i was young, i did not want to shower because i did not want to get my hair wet, her solution was to put me at risk for hypothermia by keeping in a shower with freezing water. And honestly, to this day I never got over it. I never got over the fact that she never made time for me, meaning that I had to raise myself since I was 10 years old. I never got over her tantrums. Wherever I set her off, she would threaten to knock all of my teeth out. I finally moved out after a really shitty fight that made me feel like that place was not home. The place that I am at now does not feel like home either. I have 3 roommates and the two guys that I live with are such a hassle. The first one will not pick up after their dog and there is always a mess of fur everywhere. He will not even pick up after his dog's poop from outside. The second person believes that if he does not talk about his problems, they will go away eventually. they have resorted to calling me childish and immature because I get frustrated that they cannot pick up after themselves. They do not clean, put their dishes in the dishwasher, cook, etc. Even leaving the lights on all night knowing that it will raise the electrical bill. I honestly feel like maybe I am the one that is causing the problems. I am the one that just does not understand the people around me. But I just do not feel like I can right now. My mom uses me as a punching bag because her mother is passing away, my other grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago (whom I was much closer to), having to move out, trying to locate my first job, and having to deal with my own constant thoughts...I just cannot anymore. I am trying so hard to give myself a reason to still be here because I want to live most of all. I want to fail in love. I want to grow old. But most of all, I want to try new foods and see so many new things. If I left then I would never get to finish reading my webcomics. I would never get to listen to songs from Colliding with Mars and Unlike Pluto. I would never get to finish any of my favorite games. And I am still here because I recognize that my pain would just transfer over to my family. Just the thought of it all being over, it sounds like such a blissful idea. It makes me feel like I will finally be at peace.I would not have to cry anymore. I would not have to feel hopeless. I would not have to suffer. I finally would not feel so lonely. And I would not have to deal with the fact that I am emotionally fucked up. I wish that I knew how I can make things better. I want things to change but I do not know how or where to start. Because if I have to hold on, I know that sooner or later, I will let go. And when I do, there is no turning back. Every day feels like a burden",Suicidal

51820,"Devastated after finding out my little sister has a secret boyfriend Not sure if this belongs here, but I'm so upset about this that I haven't slept all night.   
My sister is my only friend. I feel like she understands me more than anyone else. I'm completely relaxed and comfortable around her; I can just be myself without overthinking what I look like and how I come across. She's basically the only person who is able to make me laugh. I've always been open with her about my thoughts, interests and even my mental health struggles.  
I know it's not healthy to expect one person to be my entire social life, but I literally don't have anyone else I can talk to about anything.  
Yesterday I found out that she's been lying to me by saying she's meeting up with friends from school and sleeping over at her bff's apartment, when in fact she has a rich foreigner boyfriend and she's been staying over at his place. He's also been driving her on trips to nearby cities.  
I knew this day would come; my little sister had to grow up someday and get a boyfriend, but I wasn't prepared to feel so alone, abandoned and betrayed.  
She never mentioned that guy to me and my father; I'm disappointed that I had to find out about him from my mother. 
I still haven't talked to her since I found out about her relationship, but I can't fathom why she would hide it from me when I've always told her everything.  
Of course I want her to be happy, but now all I'm left to do is wait for her to get married, move to a different country and forget about me, leaving me to rot and die miserable and alone.",Personality disorder
23980,Found this group by google how I have been feeling for the longest time. Everyday I try to just sleep and stay in bed for as long as I can (way past 2pm) if I get up its for some mundane task or to take a shower. I have barely gone to work in the last few months using every excuse from Covid to just not feeling well/ lying about doing something else. I have all of the sudden just now look forward until around 6pm to justify drinking just to go to sleep and repeat it all over. Over the last few years I have exiled pretty much all of my friends by either just not contacting or making some lame excuse not to see anyone and some of the closest just blowing up on them for absolutely no just reason.. and if I do meet up with someone I feel like I am just glued to my phone and bored with that person - that urge that I do not want to be there or talk its tiring feeling. Its almost like I do not care anymore. I am still fairly young in my late 20s. I have seen a therapist but she is a bit older and I do not know I do not feel like being put on any pills etc - they were useless and just made me even more tired. How do you all force yourself out of bed and to do life? If that made sense? Do I create a schedule?Love to talk to someone that can relate.

34453,"So I'm in diagnostic phase to see if I have breast cancer and my doctors won't tell me anything. Okay so backstory. Four (4) weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit. It was hard, fixed in place and didn't hurt. I watched to see if it would go away and it didn't. So I made an appointment with my GP.

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.

They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

I've called to try and get my results from the mammogram/ultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone (which I understand).

I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.

I'm wondering if this was the process those of you with breast cancer (or any cancer really) went through test wise or do I have nothing to worry about?",Anxiety

14301,So just to let you know where my head is at these days Ill tell you about myself. I am 23M. My childhood was physically and emotionally abusive and I was neglected for a long time. The older I get I can see how this stuff has messed with me and how its always been messing with me and the way I socialize with people. I met my dad when I was 18 and he knew how my mom was but he did not want anything to do with me and my sister but he raised our half sister and gave her a great life. I never wanted to have kids and I was with this girl for 3 years and she begged me not to wear a condom said and that she was on birth control and I believed her and now she is pregnant and I am almost certain that its my daughter. She was born in April I think. I do not know her name or where she is. My ex just went crazy when she found out she was pregnant and she got back with her ex and she will not communicate with me at all. So that is what is been going on in my life. Then I met this girl and started talking to her and she seemed to really like me and I really liked her a lot too. But all my anxiety and stuff was messing with me. When someone says something good to me I cannot believe its true for some reason and I feel like things are going to get real bad. This girl is becoming a counselor and she just seemed like the girl that came right out of my dreams. We were going out and having a real good time and then I did not hear from her one day and I got real nervous and had an anxiety attack. I feel so stupid for getting like that and getting attached but I was real nervous and did not want to wait around for her to open my snap so I text her and told her how I felt and that I hope she was not ignoring me and that she can just tell me anything. She text back and was sorry but I said a lot of stupid stuff for it being that early to talk to someone. This went on for another three weeks just being like warm and not like it was before when she was sending hearts and saying good morning sweetheart and saying she loved this and that about me. So these past three weeks just killed me because she said she still wanted to get together and that everything was okay. Anyways I feel like that was too overwhelming for me and I told her how I felt and she started talking and said she was afraid it would not work out because we live like two hours away and she really wanted to be with means that she knew I was attached and she was too but she was afraid it would not work out and that she could not be what I wanted right now. I feel so stupid and I feel like I ruined things. I think I have jus got so much going on these days its already hard for me to function as it is and I was so happy to be talking to this girl it just sucks and I hate myself. I embarrassed myself so bad and ruined something that could have been great.,Depression

It has made my learning experience and time growing up tougher than I hoped for (not too sound complacive) Anyhow I skimmed by high-school and had no plans for secondary school or college because I have never found interest in getting out of bed in the morning let alone pursuing a career/passion. I graduated in June of 2020, was immediately kicked out of my dad and step moms house and couch hopped until I found a full time job and a shithole apartment to rent. Its been around a year of living here and all I do is wake up force myself out of bed, take the bus to work and keep my head down and listen to podcasts.The reason I am writing all this bullshit is because my depression and social anxiety has been amped up since I moved here. Every day I convince myself for about an hour or two that everything will be okay and that this is just the working mans life.So the reason I say I am stuck in this position is because I cannot seem to make friends or good conversation even when I try my hardest.

46756,"Delusion or just incredibly elevated anxiety? Hi everybody. Last year I was diagnosed as type 2 because I haven’t experienced what I considered to be full blown mania—only hypo, and I’m extremely prone to severe depressed “lows.” 

However, I’ve been wondering a lot lately whether or not I’m just experiencing an intense level of anxiety/insecurity or if this crosses into the area of what would be considered a delusion. I haven’t had any of the more obvious signs of delusions that I’ve read about on here (i.e. thinking I’m God or somebody else or an informant, etc.), but I most definitely feel all the time like I can tell 95-100% exactly what people are thinking about me to the point that it hinders me from functioning in many instances. For example, I will literally coup myself up in my room for days/weeks because I feel like I absolutely know exactly what my roommates or friends/family/professors are thinking of me in these high and low emotional states and I don’t want to even confront them for this reason. I’ve even accused my mom of basically “thinking her thoughts” too loud at me or even lashing out when I think she’s judging me or thinking something extremely negative. She’ll obviously say things like I’m assuming way too much and I have no clue what I’m talking about and I still don’t believe her. 
 
I know logically when I think about this that it’s ridiculous but part of me also lets it affect me to the point that I will hide myself or freak out about it. The fact that I’m partially able to understand that this obviously isn’t the true case is what dissuades me from calling it a delusion, but it’s also so strong of a fear and “observation” that it makes me wonder. What do you think? Has anybody else experienced anything this? ",Bipolar

I feel like I just went through their evaluation by other MDs a year ago and now they sent a whole package of information for me and my doctor to complete. I am so tired of being in pain everyday and struggling to get through a regular non-work day. I lost my job because of mental and physical health and there is nothing to go back to. How can they do this evaluation again? What if my doctors do not say the correct things on the forms. What if my psychiatrist retires next year?

At school i have been ""beaten"". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement.

Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late.

35203,"SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU ALL So i have been agorohobic and having panic attacks for 6 months now. I have SEVERE health anxiety and would LOVE TIPS.

So basically I have chest pains (not in the heart area. It's like far left under breast. Sharp pain sometimes) I've had ekgs and blood tests and physicals. I cannot get over the fact something is wrong. Everyday. I'm afraid if I throw up I'm going to die. So being nauseous is my biggest fear

I go to doctors every other week to get evaluated and I always get sent away. Sometimes I break down and just start to cry and say ""I can't die now. I'm so young. Please. I can't die. Help me. I don't want to die."" over and over again becuase my toe hurts.

I'm in therapy and working on it. It's ptsd from a year ago when a client (I am a CNA) I worked with closely felt a little sick and got out of the car and threw up and died as I did cpr and he bled all over me. Then 2 weeks later my grandma died. Then 2 weeks later two friends died of random heart attacks. Healthy 20 year Old college students with no history of drugs or alcohol. One was found on her bathroom floor and they found out she had an unknown genetic heart condition. The other was eating with his girlfriend and on the way home said he felt a little sick to pull over. He threw up and died of a heart attack there.

Basically I'm terrified I have a brain tumor and my physical symptoms of my panic attacks are severe. I can't speak. My throat closes and I gag. I get cold sweats and I can't even get up to pee or drink water. Every single tiny little ache or pain in my body I fixate on for the whole day and Google 50 symptoms a day. 

I take my spo2 10 times a day. Blood pressure 8 times a day and heart rate 15-30 times a day. I've never been diagnosed with any condition ever. I've never had high BP. My hr is 62.

I'm 22 and terrified daily I will die any second and I'm working SOOOO hard to not live like this. But it feels like a million things to work on at once and my health anxiety doesn't get addressed as much. ",Anxiety

Worse case scenario something happens you are right next to someone who will help you now you can relax. But try not to say what you are feeling try to distract yourself with their presence.",Anxiety
45582,"He always says he will die young.. 
A very close friend who I dated for a while was later diagnosed BP2, I am not BP. He will often make comments that he will die young and won’t be around later in life. I ask if he feels suicidal, he says no, he’s convinced he’ll die of a heart attack.

10059,"I am a (M35) who have been struggling with depression more or less my whole life.What I can remember, is that from the age of 9, I have been an extreme introvert that attempted suicide at many occasions but with the luck or bad luck based on how you look at it never succeeded.For many years I would not talk with people and had a temper that made people frightened and made some enjoy pushing my buttons until I snapped.Disappeared whole school-days and just sat at isolated places considering my options even trying to end it.First time was in a forested area outside my school age 9.Had a rope and decided ""it is time"".Trew it over a large branch and anchored it to another tree. Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son ""dad is going to work"" and he just said ""Bye"" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner.

I spent years in psychiatric care but was wrongly diagnosed and never got the help I needed. I was bullied and abused as a kid, I was extremely bright and sensitive and high hopes and a huge appetite for life. After I burned out it completely went away. Even if I could have it all I still would not be able to enjoy it because my brain is destroyed from trauma. Severe memory problems, emotional dysregulation that shifts sometimes several times a second. Chronic insomnia. Its never ending. I am incapable of doing mundane everyday tasks that can pass timeMy life has been constructed to isolate me in the most profound way and I lost the ability to occupy myself with areas of interest because of chronic anxietyI started having breakdowns where I scream in despair and wake up neighbours who calm the police.Its happened so many times I know the staff who arrive and today we even cut things short because they know there is nothing that can be doneI cannot cope with the disappointment of what my life has become. I used to be a singerI have not sung in ten years and my fits of rage have destroyed my vocal chords. I cannot even hum to myself without triggering anxiety severe ADHD ( medication does not work, it usually ends in anhedonia and uncontrollable rage attacks, ASD, burnout syndrome, seasonal depression, tinnitus, ptsd, narcissistic personality disorder, hiv positive, I was wrongly diagnosed with borderline and I have been denied the social care and therapy for years because I am labelled as a hopeless caseIve never been able to work, I did not finish school. I used to have too grades and I have rare artistic talents and a deep understanding of art and science but I have never been able to build a context where I belong. I am alone all the time, I often cannot even listen to music because of the sensory overload.I am so scared of dying but I have no realistic reasons to think this will ever change and I can tell I have gone far in the process of pushing myself to the edge and finally kill myself.I never have energy to do anything, I feel like I spent the last 20 years waiting for a bus that never arrives. These days when I call my parents I end up screaming intelligibly outof sheer desperation and I dissociate. I cannot even externalise curiosity of the world because how the system destroyed me and how the planet is dying.I am chronically depressed in a way where I am incapable of falling in love and meeting someone. I lost so many friends and opportunities. I would not even have been able to fantasise life would become so painful. The envy makes me physically nauseous and hyperventilate.

I do not know where to start, do you know that feeling you have when you are super attached to a person and everything she/he does affects your mood? Well, I am there. I am fearing for her/him to abandon me, we are just friends but I am not sure when this happened, I just cannot be happy if we are in a bad spot on our relationship. And most of the times there is no ""bad spot"", it is just me destroying myself after over-thinking about a posts, or a bad response from him/her etc. The worst part of this is that the most important person in my life does not really have that same feeling for me. I know I am important to her/him, but not the same way, and it fucking hurts, I do not KNOW WHY. And I cannot make it stop. My life is nothing without him/her, and I am ashamed of myself for that, it is just ridiculous. I am even trying to change my body because maybe he/she will like me more. He/she never told me anything bad about my body, but I feel like I need to do it. My body is not bad tbh, but I want it better, not for me but for him/her.I need some advice, what does people do to end this? it is been a lot of time and I cannot see how to get out of this wheel.

""What if I exaggerated and I am really fine?"" All of these what ifs are taking a toll on me.I know I am anxious. I always have been and I do not see that changing. I guess it feels weird because I had not considered depression before going in for a diagnosis. I guess I always pictured that depressed people experience constant sadness (I know that some do). I guess for me it just kind of feels like nothing. I am not happy or sad. I am just existing. I would not commit suicide, but life is not colorful or exhilarating. To be honest, it feels monotonous and tiring. I still have instances of brief happiness and I can distract myself with work, but when it is just me, it hits. I hate reality so I do everything I can to avoid it. I am so tired every day. I am irritable, unfocused, I have no motivation, and my memory sucks (according to my psychologist).

35427,"Nightly chest tightness For the last week and a half I have had uncomfortable chest tightness occurring only at night. I feel fine during the day (aside from the normal anxiety I have), but around 6-8pm every night I will begin to feel this pressure in my chest almost like someone is sitting on me or I have a tight band strapped around me. I feel the pressure mainly in the center to right side of my chest. Laying on my back/side seems to give a little relief. My breathing is ok but it feels like I should be having trouble breathing l (if that makes sense?). 

I am able to go to the gym and lift weights with no issues, it’s not until late in the day the tightness shows up. 

Has anyone else had a similar issue? I’m hoping it’s only anxiety since it presents with no other symptoms and goes away by the next morning.

I swing between horrible depression and even worse panic attacks/spells of psychosis.  I used to drink to 'level' myself out but in the past 4 years that really hasn't helped things and just made the psychosis worse.  Also my current gf has a flat 'no drinking' policy.

Anyway after 6 months being on the waiting list at the ONLY place my GP would refer me too, I was given a 1 hour assessment and a script for abilify.  I have a long, LONG history of eating disorders along with the alcohol abuse.  This past 13 months I have gone from being a happy 78kg (I'm 6ft 2) to a huge 115Kg because I don't have my crutch of alcohol anymore.

I'm scared of abilify.  I just took my first dose.  I'm terrified of the weight gain.  When I was 16 I was put on seroquel and I blew up like a baloon which STARTED my crippling ED bullshit.  I told all this to my psych and he assured me that Abilify was 'completely side effect free' and 'weight neutral' but my pharmacist was flabbergasted and told me I could expect a similar trail to Seroquel?

my cognitive abilities have significantly declined - i used to write so well and now i can’t even string a coherent sentence together. i’m so negative and hateful. i have zero empathy. i cannot carry a conversation anymore. i’m constantly disassociated from reality. i haven’t had friends in years. the only people i talk to are my parents and my grandma

I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass, unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our, sorry *her* room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table, that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it, I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work.

However, for me it was the most relatively stable time in YEARS. It was by no means perfect and I still wanted to die, but most of the time I actually looked forward to the next day whereas now I get a panic attack every time I wake up realizing that I did not die in my sleep. Back in 2020, I did not go to school much because of corona, so I had less school stress. My relationships with others were good, and I always daydreamed of a perfect future. let us fast forward to now. I hardly get any sleep or relaxation due to the stupid summer classes and tuitions she puts me in. I have either pushed everyone I love away because that is the asshole I am, or they pushed me away. Everyone who told me they cared for me probably do not give two shits about me now. My days are filled with worry, depression and anxiety, with some bursts of positive energy that only come from sugar and caffeine, which leave me even more tired and depressed after. Most of my time is spent in nostalgia, mostly for my childhood when my only worries were when my favorite cartoons would come on and the occasional bully, however sometimes I am nostalgic for things that happened a few months, or even a few days ago, because I am starting to realize how quickly time passes us by. To make things worse, my school starts in a few years, so more depression and anxiety is on its way. And in a few years, I will be an adult, so I will get, ""Depression, Anxiety and All the Other Negative Emotions Special Edition: Now with Bills and Student Loans!""I should have killed myself back in 2020. I should not have waited for my life to deteriorate more. If I killed myself when things were relatively good, I would have gotten a happy ending rather than the painful memories flashing before my eyes if I killed myself now. Of course, I was too scared back then and I am too scared even now.You know, if there is one thing that society's right about, it is that there is a lesson to be learnt from almost every situation. I would not say that going through all this shit was worth the lesson, but I did learn that the world and society will always be fucked up, greedy assholes, that things will never get better, that getting too attached to people too quickly is a deathtrap because 99.9% of people who say they care about you will backstab you, that the saying, ""it is better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all"" is bullshit, that only people society deems to be 'mentally healthy' and have not seen true pain hate the idea of death. People like you and me and everyone on this subreddit have been through shit that made us realize that death is probably the best part of life.

I do not disagree with this as I have experienced some of these side effects myself.But some people act like their personal negative experience can be universally applied and try to talk people out of trying meds that they might have benefitted from. And that is not okay because everybody reacts differently to the medication so you cannot know if someone else's expierience matches yours.But the worst offender are people that do not know anything about depression or how antidepressants work and come at you with rumors and half truths to get you away from the ""bad way"" of dealing with depression. There is a big stigma against using antidepressants and it really needs to disappear.BTW if antidepressants do not work for you I am not trying to invalidate your experiences.

35097,"Losing sleep over losing sleep I might have a stomach ulcer. Maybe, probably? I went to a doctor who said I might have an ulcer, but didn't do any tests. Two weeks later I went to an urgent care doctor because I had been up 30+ hours with discomfort and nausea. They did a blood test and said I was h. pylori negative, but I'd been on Prilosec for nearly two weeks and apparently that can affect the test outcome. Was told to keep taking the Prilosec. About a week later I went back to urgent care because I was still losing sleep over nausea. On three or four occasions I have woken up in the middle of the night overheated and needing to vomit, almost fainting in the process. I also have pretty consistent abdominal pain across the entirety of my abdomen, which worries me because Google says that I'd feel pain only in the middle. 

I have really bad anxiety and this health crisis has spiraled me into depression as well. I've changed my entire lifestyle in the last month over this--all I eat are carrots, potatoes, apples, peanut butter, and yogurt. All I drink is water. Everything I do I scrutinize and I'm horribly afraid something will happen to my supposed ulcer and I'll bleed out (especially since I'm away at college and hours from my family). Has anyone dealt with and been officially diagnosed with an ulcer? I'm seeing a specialist in two weeks to hopefully be diagnosed, but I'm having a hard time waiting and would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar.",Anxiety

49691,"Just started the process of getting diagnosed, I’ve spent years in denial despite obvious signs Hey everyone, to start I’m a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication he’s an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. 

I’ve shown signs of being bi-polar for a very long time now, was diagnosed with ADHD, got on the meds for that, but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II, but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. 
However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. 

I have mixed feelings, I’ve known that this was most likely the answer but I didn’t want it to be true. I hate that I have to be the one in my family to carry the “bipolar” role, I know they will look down on me and assume I’ll end up the same way that my grandpa did.",Bipolar

now I'm in full depression again, but he wants to put me on antipsychotics and I feel like that's a lot/dont wanna do it especially considering the side effects!!

but SNRI's are off limits because of triggering the mania, SSRIs and Wellbutrin haven't worked, I'm on lamictal and that hasn't worked, kind of running out of options.

I'd rather go unmedicated than doing the antipsychotics (Abilify in this case). I don't feel like I'm ""psychotic,"" even in my mania it was barely psychotic--feeling like I could feel objects emotions. 

I started crying in the psychiatry office because I feel so bad about myself that nothing works for me and also that I might have to take some drug that leads to decreased brain volume and weight gain, hair loss, dementia, Parkinson's, etc.

I am currently apartment hunting with the approval of my step-father who has agreed to help pay for an apartment of my own while I wait for disability benefits. I think it would be very helpful and therapeutic for me if I created my own space that I deemed to be sacred and worth my time. One of the fears that I have is that I would feel alone in this apartment, and fall into depression and anxiety. Maybe my meds will help with that. Also I have anxiety about needing to go out and get groceries on a weekly basis. But maybe this would be good for me and I would be able to hit up the natural food stores. I also would choose not to bring my cat with me (who is very therapeutic and supportive) because she is happy here at this home. But I won't have her around. Maybe I could get a small fish aquarium. Also I would have space for some small fitness equipment, like a kettle bell and barbell. Well I hope that if I do get an apartment it will be a good decision.

Right now, I have an opportunity to work longer at my current job and might even get a promotion 1-3 years  along the line in a position that I could basically hold for the rest of my working life.

For a long time I was like that and finally in my marriage it got pushed too far. She took the kids back to our home town and left me in the city by myself for 6 weeks. I told her not to, we fought about it lots until I finally said do whatever tf you want. After she returned was the first thing I told her I wanted a divorce. ""I will change, I will be different..."" The usual except she did not change, and a month later things were back to the way they were before, being a 2nd rate citizen to her family, constantly worried about her being happy first, and always me second. Few months later I began asking for a divorce again, and again, and again until finally she threatened me with the kids ""you will never see them, I will make the divorce a shit show, I will move home with them"" basically using the thing I fear the most against me. After about a year of continuous deterioration, I started to become close friends with girl I knew, we had a connection but nothing inappropriate happened (yet).

We got in a fight brought on me borrowing my brothers truck to help another friend move out of an abusive relationship (long story, but tldr basically had his truck too long so he freaked, so I skipped meeting my wife for lunch, so she freaked because people only think about themselves). I was intercepted walking to the overpass and hospitalized for a week. Took her 24 hours to visit.) Which is when I found understanding, no judgement, and acceptance in this friend and a relationship started in secret. Few months pass, still asking for a divorce, she takes the kids again for 5 weeks and still nothing moving towards separating and I tell her about my affair. I am done. She explodes, how could you ""cheat"" on me, you will never see the kids, etc etc UNLESS you never see the mistress again (here is the asshole part is that she was an acquaintance of my wife, friends I am not sure, not like they were close) but nonetheless it happened. She said we would have an amicable divorce, 50/50 custody, no bs. I agreed, broke it off, put the mistress through hell, gave it up not have my kids subjected to this. And then nothing happened, 2 months of sending mediation services to her until she finally says she is not going to cooperate.

47795,"Depression from stress? Hi. I’m a med school student who doesn’t know how they’re feeling. I don’t know if I’ve been feeling this way for so long because of my bad grades, which I heavily suspect but something just feels off. Like it’s not the whole picture.

Waking up every morning and getting things done are hard. If I didn’t have classes to go to, I would not move out of bed at all. Getting dressed and brushing my teeth are such a huge effort that it takes so long to get done. I feel neutral or sad almost all the time, like I forgot what feeling happiness is. Watching videos or listening to music would help sometimes, but I don’t find any fun in them anymore. I’ve mostly withdrawn from talking to my friends who don’t know but they don’t suspect anything yet.

I frequently wish I wasn’t alive by thoughts and urges but have not acted on it. Like not wanting to live but not wanting to die. I don’t know what I’m going through or if it’s all just a byproduct of stress and failure. Online tests and the DSM-5 all point to depression but my mind says I’m faking it. 

I have friends who listen, and my brother who knows about it. They all asked me to get help but I don’t know if I warrant it. Sorry if it’s a messy block of text, my thoughts are spilling as I type this. Thank you.",Depression

51747,"Anyone else from a minority community, nationality, ethnic group, religion, or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was Hispanic/Puerto Rican. They divorced when I was young (Stevie Wonder could see that one coming) and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failure/coward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and I was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned (in a western country) and has a foreign accent. Even then I feel people like that had their own community to fall back to though and I feel lost almost. Idk, forgive my rambling...

I know it's gross, but I've noticed what I would call a significant change in my stool within maybe the last year. I don't go nearly as often, and sometimes when I do, it feels like it's very little or there's more in my body that I can't get out. I think that's kind of normal, since I'm a 24-year-old female and I know my metabolism has to slow down at some point, but I feel uncertain about it. 

On top of that, I have noticed a little bit of blood in my stool. I've have had trouble with hemorrhoids in the past, so I'm pretty positive that's got to be what the blood is coming from. 

On top of THAT, I've also noticed an increasing amount of mucus in my stool, which I feel like my body may be producing to make up for my possible constipation. 

Anyway, it worries me because I know colon cancer is becoming more prevalent in adults my age. In addition, I'm not overweight, but I have a history of eating poorly, which I know can lead to colon cancer.

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit.

I'm stuck and scared guys. You know that first question they always ask you, *any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?* well I always answer no with the addendum of ""thoughts, however I would never want my family to find me like that or deal with the pain."" 

But recently the thoughts are getting worse, my mind won't stop racing, heart pounding, I'm crying one minute then angry, I'm getting little to no sleep, my paranoia of being watched by my neighbor and others is getting worse (ya, stupid I know can't help it). My psych doc I saw just last week and told him I'm really really struggling and don't think the meds have been working I'm so depressed and anxious and I've been waiting for them to ""kick in fully"" for almost six months. 

He did not address my anxiety, I brought up my meds not working three goddamn times and finally he said let's wait another month and see if it gets better. I can't wait another month, I'm in pain so bad mentally and physically. I'm tired of this, I cut my hair super short again so I would stop pulling it now but now my skin picking has doubled and that gives me anxiety about getting help because I'm worried they will think I'm on drugs cause the picking. 

I went to a inpatient facility in July last year and it didn't help at all I have been so scared of them doing nothing while I sit in a strange place for another ten days not getting better. Last time the psych doc took me off my anxiety meds as soon as I got checked in because he didn't like them and despite many freak out the clinic left me to cry hidden in the corner of my room for hours multiple days.

 Psych doc kept trying to put me back on seroquel even though I told him it makes me freak out he wanted me to try it anyways I did it did nothing but make me panic cry and my heart felt like it would burst (my BPM was 168 thought I was dying). I want to go hide for the rest of my life I want this misery to end. But I'm kinda stuck right now and it's making me panic more out of indecision. 

My mother is very ill, can't walk well and I help her, my brother is also mentally sick and I keep him together when he gets nuts. My mom is struggling right now, goes to court regarding disability soon so she's nuts and we were talking and I'm saying it's getting very hard for me daily to even live. 

She said she knows and is very sorry and shed suggest more but she's crazy right now and can't deal with the added stress and I told her OK. But I don't know if I can. I'm so tired of fixing everything else besides myself, I feel guilty about needing help, feeling suicidal, feel like a failure. I want help but I'm scared they won't do anything or flat out ignore me again. I'm very scared and unstable but I feel so fucking guilty if I leave to get help because my family needs me to take care of things they are like little children if I am not around (I am in my mid 20s now) they can't do shit it seems.

The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away, and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time, the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms, which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out!

Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 2-3 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it, as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times. Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off, so I guess i will be dropping it off completely, atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation.

Even though I feel somewhat weak and off, Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems, and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person. Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for  the truth, hopefully this will take my mind to other places.  Its wierd how something as minor as a sore throat lasting for a long time, can make you feel so sure its something serious!",Anxiety
38664,in recent week i ve been starting to learn how to live with my anxiety to the point where i very minimally get anxiety anymore anxiety itself happens a couple time a week still but it s nothing i can t handle today i had an amazing day with friend and of course we drank a lot to the point where i wa very drunk at the end which is okay bc i drink more than average i m 9 anyway it wa an unforgettable day and i went to sleep drunk af boom i wake up with the biggest anxiety attack i ve had in month out of nowhere you all understand anxiety attack so hopefully you get it when i say that i wa totally convinced my body woke me up because i wa dying in my sleep or that a heart attack wa nearing now i m calming down on the couch at 0 am watching the office when i just want to sleep what i just want to get off my chest is that i hate that this stupid disorder follows me around in every aspect of my life it s just really depressing there s nothing i can do to make it stop ever it s just depressing that it s always there around the corner waiting for me i wa so proud of myself for learning how to deal with anxiety but now this shit happened to me and i just feel tired about it i honestly wouldn t wish this on my worst enemy i wouldn t wish it on anyone if i had to choose between infinite money or not having to live with anxiety ever again i d choose the latter every fucking time sorry but i just had to vent about this im just tired,Depression
23148,"I just wish that life was different. My life is not even that bad on the outside, I have a great family, I live in a decent area, I do not really have many external struggles, and when I say that I do not mean to brag I am simply saying it for a little bit of context. I am 19 years old and for as long as I can remember I have just had this emptiness inside of me. I do not like to talk about it a lot with the people around me but it really is something that just eats at me. It feels like there is no middle ground for my emotions. One minute I can feel like life is great and the next I just wish I had not been born in the first place. I just wish I was not here. I have felt this way since I would say I was around 11 or 12. It feels like any bit of happiness I get is just a temporary high but I always come down and sink into this dark place that I cannot crawl out of. No matter what I just always end up finding myself in this pit. I just think of how I wish none of this had ever happened, I could have just not been born. I think about suicide a lot, but its not something I truly want to act on. Its not that I want to die, I do not truly want to die, I just wish Id never been here. I am not necessarily afraid of death, it feels like I am just kind of waiting for it to happen. I would not search for it but I am also not afraid of it happening. Id like to think that it would be comforting to know that everything just goes away. It would just be over. No more stress, no more sadness, no more worrying about this or that, just the peaceful notion that I do not have to deal with anything anymore. Does anybody else feel this way? I am tired of living a day to day life and feeling like I am trapped in this reality I want nothing to do with. I just want to be at peace. I just wish it had never happened in the first place.

23192,"Being in the class of 2020 I always thought that my life would lead me to either joining The military or going to college. However, when the pandemic hit everything in my life turned upside down. I lost friends, I lost family and I lost myself. For starters, I would go to the recruiting office every day, because my recruiter would call me fat and dumb if I did not show up. I remember specifically one day I gained 1 pound after losing 15 for her. And when she found out about that one pound she put me on a water diet where I only drink liquids. However this dinner because I gained some of the weight back. From that point on, I knew she starts to lose hope when I have seen her talk to my other friends about me. From there I caught Covid, and could not leave my bed for a whole month. And When I went back to the recruiting office, I saw more as a faker than a human being. Moving forward, from that point on we had a chat, and she told me straight up that I would not do anything good in my life, and she said that the army is the only good thing for me. That night I starved myself from June 25-29 hoping to get skinnier to show her that I was right. However, I found out the hard way, that it did not help but made my weight worse. It has now been a year since I starved myself. However nothing has changed, I had a sit down with my family, About how I want to do college and try it out, so I can have a back plan. Except for being met with all right feedback, I was met with feedback that made my thoughts worsen. From calling me a retard to me getting told I will never be good enough . Sadly every time I try to bring this up, either call me names to stop the conversation or hide my paperwork of colleges.

49628,"Slipping Into A ""Classic"" Depression Very Weird For Me. So it's been years like 15+ years since I've had a depression that was not a mixed episode.   I'd been pretty stable tye past 3 years, but my migraines at least that's what my doctor thinks they wre (had them for years) have been getting worse.   Last year I wound up in the ER with one so bad that I went from moving under my own steam to get in the door (with the worst pain in my life, made running over my foot with a one story tall steel gate feel like kiddy play) to needing help into a wheel chair cause I couldn't even stand.   

I've had 3 rounds of blood work all normal a CT scan and MRI normal.   Now an oximetry test Tuesday night. (Waiting on doctor to interpret the results) and an appointment with a neurologist august 9th (soonest they had) and required taking a personal day off work cause it won't fit well in my work day.  

They've never actually gone away.    Even on days I don't record as having one I low-key always have pain, just it's at a threshold tolerable enough I can for tye most part ignore it.   But most days of the week I've got headache and/or the front of my ""brain"" feels like it's being prickled with pins and needles (not in pain those, thats reserved for my temples and the icepicks behind my eyes) it makes my brain mush, and makes me feel physically weak.   But every appointment I have because of that they test for a stroke but I come out normal/no stroke. And my mind is mush it can't think it's way out of a wet paper bag full of holes, heck it will even struggle for forum words.

I just feel so hopeless and empty and broken. Like a pathetic, worthless loser and failure at everything,. That I'm not worth shit.   And between tye two I'm always exhausted and don't have the energy or will to do things and even when I force myself I feel like I'm shit at it. But I'm also super irritable and pissy and angry alot.   So much of the time I could scream and shout but cry and beat myself in the head at the same time.   I struggling very hard to use my logic and tools to get out from under all this.",Bipolar

22757,"I have been depressed since I was 10. I am 29 now. I do not remember feeling happy ever. I have felt joy for short periods, but for as long as I remember I have just wished I did not exist. For years I have dreamed and toyed with the idea of ending it, but it has never been an option because it would hurt my family. But now thinking rationally why am I supposed to suffer with this faulty mind? If I feel I would be better of gone then why would not the people that care about me be happy that I was able to set my self free from my mind?When I was younger I still had something to wait for which maybe got me going on minimal effort. ""I will just see if finishing school improves things just a little."", ""Maybe I will be happier when I get my drivers license because I have wanted to drive for years"". Well after ""achieving"" these things I always returned back to suffering quickly.I now have everything I have ever dreamed for and more. I had friends. I have a caring family.. I have all material things I want and need. I accidentally had a relationship that ended a month ago. I had given up on women long ago because I was sure I would just bring pain to someone that got close to me. A really good girl just happened to fall for me and I went with the flow. Not surprisingly it ended quickly and the girl got hurt. I spiraled lower than ever and maybe it is time for me to be objective and understand that I am not fit for life or this society.there is just no purpose in my life. There never has been and objectively why would there ever be. I do make profit for the company I work for and the government does get some tax out of me.

10051,"I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time ""it will be fine, you can talk to me!"". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ ""friends"" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end, there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this, odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself. I only ever needed comfort, not cops",Suicidal

I have thought about it, what my friends could do to help and there are only two i can talk to. one is currently on vacation with family, and the other i just got in touch with a few days agoa nd cannot bare the idea of already dumping this shit pile onto. and honestly, maybe it is better this way. i mean nothing. i am nothing. and it hurts to admit that all I have ever tried to be, all I have wanted to become is feeble and pitiful. i cannot bare it, to live in such toxic envornment where i have to go to school and be the perfect student everyone expects, where i have to wake up everyday and be the perfect daughter (which i am not, i tried to come out to my parents and they refused to listen), where i am just naive and stupid, and en extnetion for their distress. i have to listen to the troubles of adults or am threatened with being treated like a worthless rag, where my ability to contact friends is little and supervised, where i constantly have this thing wrong with me (whether it be depression, a personality disorder, or just my adhd) ignored and gaslighted into a quirkiness i want to possess. i try so hard, i really do, but what for i attone to nothing. i just want to be a kid, but all I have ever known is the need to be others validation and support. i cannot do that anymore. &amp;#x200B;i do not know what i need to hear, but please, say it, because i do not know how much longer i can go on. and this time, i fear, i might not be as cowardly enough to tell my parents.

They keep insinuating that I will not ever get better and that I am lazy and will not do anything with my life. How do I not go back to the dark place I was?A month ago was the first time I had felt genuine joy since 5th grade. After so many years of suicidal thoughts and apathy towards my life and future I started to have plans for my future, I started to think about studying languages, I started to say no, I finally was standing up for myself.I now know I can do whatever I want to do. I now know I have friends that love me as much as I love them, and they are so happy that I am doing better, that I hang out with them, they are proud of me. And my therapists have also told me that I am clearly doing better, and they are also happy for me.I feel like I am rediscovering life, without this dark veil that was covering my face because of my past and my family. Speaking of family, unlike my friends I feel like they do not trust me to move on and have my own life, they demoralize me and I just feel like I am going backwards on my progress when I am back home (I live with them). They keep saying things like ""you have to work, you have to study blablabla"" ""what if you start acting like before"" in a very condescending and negative manner, as if I was the lazy useless person I thought I was for all these years. And whenever I talk about doing things with my life they are always like ""yeah but if you want to do those things you have to start working otherwise you are not going to do anything"", like, I know all those things, they do not need to constantly repeat that all the time.They do not believe in me and I am scared that I might go back to where I was.

For some background. I am a type 1 diabetic. Type 1 is similar to type 2, but it is also different. Type 2, it has a known because, and affects the pancreas in way that makes it semi work. Type 1 has no known because and it affects the pancreas in a way were it makes it totally useless. And dealing with this disease is hard. High and low blood sugars are hard to deal with. Sometimes I cannot eat when or what I want to. I go to a camp that is for kids like me. And that camp is family to me. Counselors taught me how to deal with it, and how to not let this disease define me. And I am becoming a future counselor and I want to spread this. they taught me PMA. PMA is not just for diabetics, its for any problem you have, and is basically a life style.PMA stands for Positive Mental Attitude. It means to accept things and roll on with life. Accept that your in a shitty situation. Accept that you have NO control when you do not. You can waste so much energy trying to control a situation you cannot, and can make you feel worse. But be hopeful. Look towards the future and see what YOU can do that is within your control. do not look back in the past too much. do not think about how you should have done something else in a situation in the past too much. Its okay to think about it and have regrets. But do not get mad at yourself and constantly be looking back at your fuck up, wether it was your fault or not. And last of all its okay to be sad. Its okay to feel upset about a situation that did not got our way but do not let control you and get the best of you. Use this mindset and it really helps. From Personal experiences!

21192,"I feel completely lost with things. Too many overwhelming things have happened at once and I feel like there is so much that I cannot even process it anymore. I have kept everything together for my friends and family but I just feel like everyone takes and takes from me. I have always had issues with depression and anxiety but something changed in me a few years ago when I went through a profoundly traumatic loss, followed by several other less-traumatic-but-still-traumatic losses. I did not seek out help because I was busy trying to help the people around me cope with their feelings, because that literally has always been my role to anyone, someone who makes things better and takes care of everyone. I still deal with the grief but more or less deal with it by crying a few times a week which really helps. Life was kind of sorting itself out in late 2019; in a relationship that seemed to be amazing, work was going well, I was done with graduate school and basically enjoying life other than some boredom here and there. Things really started going downhill in Feb 2020. I did not handle the shutdowns well because everything closed around me, and I started getting anxious about needing dental care or something and not being able to go in. My boyfriend also started becoming super withdrawn and it was really difficult for me to not be able to help him more because I genuinely did everything I could, like he told me to ease up on him and to want less and this and that, I did everything he asked. A lot of our relationship died during that period but we stayed together because overall we were good and he kept saying that if I made the changes he asked and his stress went down that we could go back to being how we were in the beginning. So I did all of that. But it did not change anything. And it kills me to know that he gave infinitely more to his ex even though she was a genuinely bad person, like it makes me feel like I must be just completely awful.At the same time, I had a huge fight with my best friend and we did not talk for months, I almost lost my main job, I lost my side job, it was just a really bad period of time. Things started getting a little better in fall 2020 and then throughout the spring of 2021 I felt overall better. This all pretty much drastically changed about a month ago. My boyfriend and I had a fight but instead of reconciling as normal, he remained distant and remains distant. I have tried to talk to him about it so many times but he acts like I am berating him, when I am not, I just want to try to work things out. Around this time, I started getting vertigo and weird dizziness, which is really disturbing to me, and which does not seem to be completely related to the anxiety as it remains even when I take Klonopin, do yoga, or talk myself through the anxiety. Shortly after that, I tried to confide about it to my best friend and my mom but all my best friend said was you Googled too much and all my mom has to say is stuff like, oh, treatment will probably help but how much will it help? I feel utterly devoid of life. I am effectively housebound because of the dizziness and I get dizzy if I even go for a walk outside. I cannot do any of the stuff that I used to love doing, like going to the store, going outside, playing video games, any of it. All I have looked forward to all year was Halloween and Christmas 2021 and I was super excited that Halloween stuff was starting to come out in stores and that movie theaters were opening up (two of my favorite things to entertain myself with). I can no longer participate in exploring either of these hobbies and it kills me. Like its so soul-crushing to have had these things I have used to hold onto my sanity for the past year and a half, and now its..gone. I am so anxious about having to do tests and stuff to possibly find out what is causing my dizziness and what if I cannot even find a treatment for it? What if I go through the tests and it makes it worse? I feel so isolated and just completely hopeless about everything. All I can think about is how much more comforted Id be if the ones I lost a few years ago were still around. I am exhausted that I have constantly given so much of myself to others and now I just.. like beg for scraps of something back from them. I just feel like I cannot deal with any of it anymore. I cannot deal with this future of medical issues. I cannot deal with trying desperately to find support from people who really do not seem to give a shit. I am struggling with the loss of what I had with my boyfriend and with not even being able to talk it out with him to try to fix stuff. I have all of this energy that I used to give him that now has nowhere to go because he does not want it and I am tired of giving it just to have strained conversation or excuses for why he cannot love me more in return. My confidence is completely shot because I gave all of my entire soul to him and I was turned down many times for over a year now. My days and nights are consistently so lonely and I feel even more lonely now that I cannot even leave the house because I am so afraid of being dizzy and passing out or something in public.

The only person I was sticking it out for is gone and I doubt will come back. We ended on good terms but fuck it, life is and has been silent agony for the last 14 years. All my family that loved me (my mom, aunt, grandpa, first dog) are dead or have dementia (my grandma). No one else gives a flying fuck about me so come the week of the 18th I am going to treat myself for a few meals to a dinner at a local expensive Italian restaurant, and maybe a few other places have t decided yet since I will be all alone that week. I think my last meal is going to. Be steak Mac n cheese and enough wine to get drunk off my ass with so I can get the balls to just hang myself or jump off a close bridge into the river (at least 40 feet from bridge to water). I cannot stand being alone. We had plans to get an apartment together in August, we have a dog together. I really thought we could be together for ever but clearly I am unlovable even by my own family I guess it no surprise. I am tired. So fucking tired of feeling less than others, like I am not worth love or time from other people. My dad and his fiance are getting married around those days, oh fucking well. Enjoy you wedding and honeymoon and all the rest of your summer. Never invited me to anything fun, just assumed I would rather sit out and rot or god forbid spend time with me to go see a fucking movie. Nope. Rather go golfing with someone else at the spur of the moment. You, her and your friends and her kids go wine tasting even after telling me no because it is too expensive. Go fuck yourselves. you have always been a shitty father and a shitty husband. No fucking wonder mom left your ass. I would too if I had a husband like you.Now on to your precious son Matt, oh if only the shit you knew he did to me as a child. He ruined my chances at growing up in a normal house because you let him go off his bipolar medications. Also never though I would put it out there but he molested me when I was 7. So go gloat how proud you are of him some more.Tom. I am proud of you. You were a good big brother and although we are not close. You were still kind to me growing up and I appreciate that even though we are not blood related. I am not angry at you in anyway and I hope this does not affect you. Sue,Joe, Megan.

9642,"I went on vacation this week for a wedding. I was the best man. I did it out of obligation to my best friend of 18 years. I have had active suicidal ideation and rumination over negative thoughts almost daily for over a year, following the end of my own engagement.The day before the wedding, I went into a canyon trail in the Rockies some 2000 miles away from my very flat homeland. I had multiple reasons: clearing my head for the best man speech I had not finished, exercise, and I was passively searching for a good spot to jump if the desire was there.I started at the bottom of the trail as miserable as usual. It was hot and dry. Hot sand was getting in my sandals.When you get about a third through, you run into greenery and you start to hear the promise of a river. Following the trail a bit more takes you to a small stream where you can appreciate the sounds and the drop in heat. The snowmelt will be almost ice cold on a scorching day even this far down.Up the trail, it gets a little redundant again, but just as you start to resent the effort, you see another formation of rock and water or a large ancient tree. As you get to the penultimate portions, you have steep rock paths that you can no longer simply tread without using your hands, but at this point, every sight you are seeing is more beautiful than the one that came before it, so there is only joy in the effort.At last, when you get to the waterfall, the payoff seems better than anything you anticipated. The pool at the base is knee-deep. The water is refreshingly cold and clear. And the sounds are more rewarding than any music you had on your earbuds on the way there.It was like a religious experience. It was fundamentally mood altering. The day or so after was the first time in over a year where I had zero rumination over negative thoughts, not to mention no ideation. And I killed the speech according to about 20 people. I was able to actually enjoy my best friend being happy. I was enjoying the new connections I made, and I really felt like my best days were not behind me.TL;DR: It sounds cliche, but try hiking, especially if you have something requiring the right amount of payoff for your effort. it is like a microcosm of flow (the psychological concept).

i have adhd, sensory processing disorder and an on the gifted spectrum. 
recently i’ve been going to therapy for adhd, and a few weeks ago my psych brought up that i might have bipolar. i’ve done a lot of research and have talked a lot about it when her,and i definitely have bipolar.
im going to see a psychiatrist and try to get meds for it, but i wanted to see if anyone else is like this before i get it checked out.

i do not experience intense anger. like… at all.
even before i started questioning if i had bipolar, i knew that i didn’t have the ability to get angry. 
sure, i get irritated- but that’s only at my family members. in public i don’t display or even feel anger. 

maybe it’s because as a girl, any negative or ‘masculine’ emotion is seen as undesirable, but plenty of girls get angry.


i know not all people with bipolar experience aggressive behaviour, but i feel like i should at least be a little angry? i’m irritable at the most, and i feel like it’s the only trait of bipolar i DONT experience.

52409,"Coming to terms with anxiety as an adult, looking back it was pretty obvious and nobody talked about it. Hi friends, new poster here. Turns out my entire family suffers from anxiety, and nobody shared this with me. My mom was medicated for it briefly, my dad is medicated for it and also has PTSD, and it runs in both sides of the family. I figured it out in my early 20's and I have been seeing all these  things about myself in a new light ever since. Currently suspicious that I might have ocd.

Something I am frustrated with is that I had a lot of signs and symptoms, but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time. In highschool I had one friend, and she was always telling me I was a worrywart, and openly mocked me about things I did. (For example, I could never just cross a street. Had to be with the walk signal, and then I would RUN across it, and one day she made a big deal about it to my face)

Nobody ever asked WHY. Why I had almost no friends, why I didn't learn to drive until I was almost 30, why I am always going around giving people warnings about their safety. One time I had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced, which was very rare for me. And my mom said ""she's just being dramatic and wants attention"" and that was the end of that. I was also ""the responsible one"". They just don't have time for my feelings.

I try to talk to my dad, who seems like the person who would understand the most, and I'll say ""I have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious"" and he will go ""SPEAKING OF ANXIETY AND DRIVING, YOUR SISTER HAS COME ALONG SO FAR IN HER DRIVING!"" Or I will try to tell him I think I might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what I'm saying to him.

48919,"How can you reduce the stress in your life? We all experience stress in our lives, but sometimes it can become overwhelming. If you're feeling stressed out, there are some things you can do to reduce the amount of stress in your life.

➲ **Identify the source of your stress**.

One of the first steps to reducing stress is to identify the source of it. What is it that's causing you to feel stressed? Once you know what it is, you can start to figure out ways to deal with it.

➲ **Make a plan**.

If you know what's causing your stress, make a plan to deal with it. If it's something you can't change, like a work deadline, make a plan to better manage your time so you don't feel so overwhelmed. If it's something that's causing you anxiety, like a fear of public speaking, make a plan to face your fear head-on.

➲ **Take a break**.

When you're feeling stressed, sometimes the best thing you can do is take a break. Step away from whatever is causing you stress and take some time for yourself. Relax and rejuvenate and you'll be better equipped to deal with the stressor when you're feeling refreshed.

➲ **Talk to someone**.

If you're feeling stressed, talking to someone can be a great way to relieve some of the tension. Talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or anyone who will listen and can offer support. Just getting things off your chest can be a huge stress relief.

➲ **Eat healthy and sleep enough**.

A a healthy diet is also important for managing stress. Be sure to include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet.

Also, make sure to get enough sleep. When we’re tired, we’re more likely to feel stressed. aim for eight hours of sleep every night.

➲ **Exercise**.

Exercise is a great way to reduce stress. Not only does it help to release tension, but it also boosts endorphins, which can make you feel happier and more relaxed.

➲ **Practice Relaxation techniques**.

Consciously relax your body, through practices like progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, meditation, or simply taking some deep breaths.

50608,"psychiatrist told me not to google my medication, feeling weird about it starting this off by establishing that I am autistic, and one of my interests is self categorization. this can make me come across as a hypochondriac or doctor shopper, as I know my disorders/illnesses very well. once I started seeking treatment for my bipolar I learned everything there was to learn, joined communities such as this one, and started talking to others with bipolar.

as a result of this, I learned a lot about medication. not even really on purpose, learning about the meds people are on is just an inevitable of being in a group like this.

my psyche prescribed me abilify today, and out of curiosity I asked if that was the med known to sometimes lead to tardive dyskinesia. I'm not against trying abilify, all meds can have horrible side effects, but I wanted to know if that's what I was potentially getting myself into. I love my psyche, she's super nice and receptive, but she sorta laughed and told me to ""stop googling your medication"" which rubbed me the wrong way. it's a drug I'm unfamiliar with, should I not want to be prepared for the potential risks? I've told her before I'm open to trying anything, so it's not like I was telling her I wouldn't take it because I was scared, I was just asking a question so I know what to look out for.

I'm very hesitant about identifying myself with a disability. I was able to stay on my dad's insurance with a letter from my doctor but I'm not sure what applies for this. I'm really nervous about letting any of my employers know I am Bipolar. I'm pretty good at hiding my illness but I have depressive dips that last for a few months and they affect my work. I'm on medication but currently I've been having hormonal issues that I'm dealing with my gyno. I get very antisocial and irritable but I am afraid of my work trying to get rid of me if they knew.

20139,"I was diagnosed with it early in life, but I have always dealt with it. Just as I have gotten a bit older, it seems to have become a more constant, more permanent fixture to my existence.In the past, you could maybe attribute it to this or that, like bad luck or even substance abuse. Or even the loss of friends and/or family or other traumatic events, but I am years-past such events and I have better habits now. Plus, out of sheer necessity, I kind of remobilized myself and even got an excellent job again at the start of the year. Something I am good at, that I can do well. So, I cannot really ""work on"" those aspects anymore. I am legit in all that again. it is like I made it somewhere, but it changed nothing internally.But things I do, none of it changes my utter lack of feeling. My total disinterest in life. No matter the changes I make, things that would be considered (and are) positive, do nothing to elevate my mood and general outlook on life. Whether I am in elite physical condition again or not, or earning good money or not, none of it really helps. It feels really nice to be able to buy something for someone I care about, but every time I get paid, it almost all just goes to my savings. Like, I just have no real motivation or ambition. it is like a burnout or something, like just being so worn out from carrying great responsibility at times, for so long.I honestly cannot think of much to buy, that I really want. One of the last holdouts was video-games. I have always enjoyed them but lately, I do not really even feel motivated to do gaming of my own. Then the other day, a really sweet coworker of mine gave me a really nice compliment, but I just kind of smiled and felt kind of sad about it, for some reason. Like, I felt like it was wasted on me and that she would be better off devoting that energy to someone else.And yeah, I do have unhealthy, self-destructive thoughts that, at times, seem comforting. I try not to indulge them. it is all fairly dysfunctional at times. I disappoint myself here.It sucks too because I cannot give up. There is not one person on this Earth to whom I can run for support. everyone is gone, moved on, or I just blew it with them and they do not want anything to do with me. So, if I do not earn a check, I have nothing. I must continue and it is all just bleak at times, since I would really wish just to go somewhere far away, somewhere dark and isolated. Like a sanctuary for despair, which I hate to say.it is just a reality of my life and it kind of sucks that I have not been able to move past it much, despite accomplishing some great things recently. Rather, it seems more a part of me, more certainly, than before. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Just I would been carrying these thoughts for sometime now.

Almost every single popular post in this sub, (all the behaviors from reading it here and other mental health sites) I find super specific to me.

26777,"I have struggled with mental illness my whole life. From the early age of 6 I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. Later on at about 10 I was diagnosed with ADHD, and than a few years later diagnosed with depression. My first depressive episode took place when I was on middle school, and after seeing a therapist weekly and going on meds I soon became happy and content with my life. However, a few years later (now) I (F17) decided to try and go off my meds. Talking to my parents, doctor, and therapist, we decided to give it a try. And for the first month or so, I was completely fine. Nothing was wrong, and I felt good. But I soon after had fell into a depressive episode. My trigger was, and had been the time before, an internal feeling that I was not good enough. This time the trigger had been not getting a part I wanted in a show I was acting in, pushing all these intrusive thoughts into my head. The main one that I have struggled with however is the thought of suicide. I do not know why. I do not want to die, I do not want everything to end, but I cannot shake the thought. And over the next few months, it just got worse. I ended up getting into a relationship with a guy from school and we have been dating for almost 3 months. Over this time though I have developed ROCD to the point where I think of my bf and I immediately feel miserable. I feel so bad because he likes me so much, and I cannot stop with all the ROCD intrusive thoughts. It got to the point where I would nervous vomit every time I knew I was going to see him. I have no idea what to do. I have ruined multiple events/vacations/parties for myself by just ruminating on the ROCD thoughts of whether I actually like him or not or if were supposed to be together. I have just fucked up the past few months of my life and relationship. Since then, I have gone back on my meds and am seeing my therapist more frequently. Me and my bf are currently on a break, but we are meeting up to decide on what to do in 3 days. I have genuinely been better when I have been able to focus on myself, but I really do not want to break up with him, however hard the relationship might be. I have major guilt from the depression and ROCD thoughts and I do not know what the next step to take is.

Also i feel like she is sexually attracted to me (i am 17 now) and uses some shitty pretending to touch me between my legs or butt. I once tried to talk with my dad about it, but he said that he and mom have enough to do and i should pull myself together. I feel like i really have to seek help, but i am so scared that people wont take me serious and think i am exaggerating.",Stress

8265,Tried 4 times. Did permanent damage but even failed at killing myself. My life just keeps getting worse no matter how hard I try. I have a rare genetic illness that makes me extremely sensitive to drugs and alcohol. I figure maybe I can slowly kill myself by just drinking or something. it will be slower than I want but faster than others because of this illnesses. Idk shit about drugs and alcohol though. Just want to die. I am done. Please :( 28. Never done drugs or drank. Might start because I apparently cannot even kill myself right.,Suicidal

19413,"I have been feeling a giant mental breakdown coming for the past few days, ever since my mom started shit with me last week. she is got to be a sociopath or something bc she truly feels no remorse and has no sympathy for anyone but herself. she is a crazy gaslighter and always makes me feel like everything is my fault when I know that it is not. Anyway, I have been having an abundance of issues that have all started after my dad unexpectedly passed away last year. I think its due to the immense amount of stress and grief. Its very upsetting bc these health issues take so much of my life away - I have physical limitations now and very strict diet restrictions. Its a very hard adjustment especially when its all hitting at the same time. I have been able to handle it tho up until my mom starts shit with me. Then I just get so triggered I break all the way down. So I have been extremely upset due to all of this. I was writing a list of all the reasons I hate my life. And literally as I am in the middle of writing, my mom walks in the door and starts more shit with me. I am shaking and I feel so paranoid and even delusional, like I am losing touch with reality I am so upset. All these memories of the past year come flooding back. I am so stuck cannot get a break",Depression

13853,"I am so done. I have to deal with my parents constantly breaking down my confidence that I am trying to work on and being VERY mentally abusive. I get comments about my weight, my intelligence, my clothing style, my actions, etc. I cannot even breath without being judged. my parents like to twist the word ""respect"" so i get treated like shit but then I have to walk on eggshells when I am around them. it is not like I am a bad kid. I have A's/B's, planning for college, never get into any trouble, yet I am constantly ridiculed like I am the worst kid in the world. Then I have my friends where recently they have been judging me as well for multiple things. They make my parents sound like they are ""the best and chillest parents ever"" when they have NO idea what happens behind closed doors. I have ADHD and anxiety and one of the things that I do is that I cannot function if my hands are dry so i carry around lotion with me. EVERY time i would take out the lotion they would give me a weird look. They also like to call me out on a lot of things or call me names just at random and it does not help my already not very mental state. My one friend has called me a 'pig' before on multiple occasions and always has to point out my SH scars and call them 'tic tac toe' like its some sort of joke when all it does is make me want to cut again. I am trying so hard to work on myself and work on my confidence but I feel like I am suffocating. OH also to mention I have found out alcohol causes my spiraling thoughts to temporarily go away so now I am trying not to start an addiction to either SH or Alcohol but I have no one to fucking help me or be there for me without having that feeling of being judged. I also had my girlfriend try to hurt herself and her homophobic parents found out about us so now I have not heard from her for over 2 weeks. I am trying to cope with everything and no one even seems to care. I am just a fucking kid yet I feel like everyone is treating me like I should know how to fix every single problem I have. I want someone to hold my hand and tell me it is going to be okay. I want that embrace of a hug that makes me feel like all my problems have gone away. I want help. I want to be happy like how I was when I was younger. Why did I have to grow up so fast. I am done with constant mental abuse",Depression

48699,"My mind &amp; body choses flight instead of fight.  I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, ""How do I feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""Ohhh really like what"".

So she asks, ""Okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, ""Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?",Stress
16766,"I am in my early years of high school. I feel fucking horrible just thinking about how nothing happens. it is not like I do not have friends it is that my friend group just does not try to do anything outside of computer games. I do play a lot of computer games myself but I just cannot fucking take not going out. since my friends do not do shit I try to make shit work with other people in different groups and it kind of works but not to a degree where I can go out with them and have a good time. The number of holidays and breaks I have spent rotting away in my room doing absolutely nothing, staring at a screen for 12 hours makes me sadder and sadder but this is all I can do. I often look at others Snapchat or insta stories and see them having a fucking blast and it hits me that I am so alone in my room. I do not want to ask anybody else to go out with me because I am scared that ill look desperate. The only reason I want to go out is that I want to take my mind off school. I do not do bad at school but I do not necessarily do well either. I am just a mediocre student. Every time I come back home with a passing grade without trying my parents lovingly say ""you are smart but you just do not try. We know you can do it"" and it demoralises me to realise that I want things to change but I do not make it happen. It leaves me believing that my parents deserve a better son. Every time I feel sad, I feel guilty for being sad even though I have a loving family and a great group of friends. I am sorry if this is just hormone-filled teen talk but i just though I would write this out I do not even think I should be sad",Depression
